</blockquote>


<p>It is an awful thing to be told that one has
made history, or done something historic.
Such an accusation implies the duty of living
up to other people's expectations; and merely
an ordinary person who has been lucky, like
myself, cannot fulfil such expectations.</p>

<p>Sir John Alcock and I have been informed
so often, by the printed and spoken word, that
our achievement in making the first non-stop
transatlantic flight is an important event in the
history of aviation that almost&mdash;but not quite&mdash;I
have come to believe it. And this half-belief
makes me very humble, when I consider the
splendid company of pioneers who, without due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>recognition, gave life, money or precious years,
often all three, to further the future of aëronautics&mdash;Lilienthal,
Pilcher, Langley, Eiffel,
Lanchester, Maxim, the Wrights, Bleriot, Cody,
Roe, Rolls and the many daring men who
piloted the weird, experimental craft which
were among the first to fly.</p>

<p>I believe that ever since Man, but recently
conscious of his own existence, saw the birds,
he has desired to emulate them. Among the
myths and fables of every race are tales of
human flight. The paradise of most religions
is reached through the air, and through the air
gods and prophets have passed from earth to
their respective heavens. And all authentic
angels are endowed with wings.</p>

<p>The present generation is lucky in that, despite
this instinctive longing since the beginning
of human history for the means of flight,
it is the first to see dreams and theories translated
into fact by the startling development of
practical aviation, within the past fifteen years.
The aëronautical wonders of the next fifteen
years are likely to be yet more startling.</p>

<p>Five years ago, before the offensive and defensive
needs of war provided a supreme <i>raison
d'être</i>, flying was but a costly and dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>pastime. As such it attracted the first-class
adventurers of every race, many of whom lost
their lives on weird, Jabberwock-like aircraft,
built and tested before experimental data and
more accurate methods of calculation became
available.</p>

<p>But even these men could not realize the wonderful
possibilities of the coming air age, of
which they were the pioneers. Nearly all the
early aëroplanes were born of private enterprise,
for capitalists had no faith in the commercial
future of flight. Very few firms applied
themselves solely to the manufacture of
aircraft or aëro engines, and only two or three
of the great engineering companies had the
vision to maintain aëronautical departments.</p>

<p>Among the few important companies that, in
those days, regarded aëronautics seriously was
Messrs. Vickers, Ltd. They established an experimental
department, and as a result of its
work began to produce military types of aircraft
which were in advance of their period.
Later, when the whirlwind of war provided the
impetus which swept pioneer aviation into
headlong progress, the Vickers productions
moved with the times, and helped largely to
make the British aircraft industry the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>in the world. Now that aviation has entered
into the third phase of its advance&mdash;that of a
peace-time commercial proposition&mdash;they are
again in the forefront of production. Incidentally
they provided me with the greatest chance
of my life&mdash;that of taking part in the first non-stop
flight across the Atlantic. Since then a
Vickers aëroplane has won yet another great
distinction&mdash;the prize for the first flight from
England to Australia.</p>

<p>At this point I desire to pay a very well-deserved
tribute to the man who from the beginning
has backed with money his faith in the future
of aviation. The development of aëronautics
has been helped enormously by the generous
prizes of Lord Northcliffe and the <i>Daily Mail</i>
for the first flights across the English Channel,
from London to Manchester, around the circuit
of Britain, and finally across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>In each case the competitions seemed impossible
of fulfilment at the time when they were
inaugurated; and in each case the unimaginative
began with scoffing doubts and ended with
wondering praise. Naturally, the prizes were
offered before they could be won, for they were
intended to stimulate effort and development.
This object was achieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>But for the stimulus of these competitions,
Great Britain, at the beginning of the war,
might well have been in an even worse position
as regards aviation than she was. And all who
flew on active service during the first three years
of the war realize what they owe to Lord Northcliffe's
crusades for more and better machines,
and for a more extensive use of aircraft.</p>

<p>Having helped to win one of the <i>Daily Mail</i>
prizes, I am not going to quarrel with the principle
of flying competitions. Certainly, the
promise of reward brings to the surface ideas
and potential powers which might otherwise lie
fallow; but I do not believe the system of money
prizes for spectacular flights to be altogether
an economically sound proposition. It is not
generally realized that as a rule the amount
spent by each of the firms that enter a machine
for such a contest as the transatlantic flight
vastly exceeds the amount of the prize, although
the money reward more than covers the expenses
of the aviators who gain it.</p>

<p>Would it not be more practical to pay directly
for research work? Anybody with vision can
see some of the infinite possibilities which the
future of aviation may hold, and which can only
be found by painstaking and properly applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>research. There are plenty of men able and
anxious to devote themselves competently to
seeking for yet-hidden solutions whereby flying
will be made cheaper, safer and more reliable.
What is especially wanted for the moment is
the financial endowment of research into the
several problems that must be solved before the
air age makes the world a better place to live
in, and, by eliminating long and uncomfortable
journeys, brings the nations into closer bonds
of friendship, understanding and commerce.</p>

<p>Apart from the honor of taking part in the
first non-stop flight between America and Great
Britain, I am especially pleased to have helped
in a small way in the construction of a new link
between the two continents to which I belong.
My family is deeply rooted in the United
States; but generations ago my ancestors were
English, and I myself happened to be born in
Glasgow.</p>

<p>This was in 1886, when my parents were visiting
that city. I was an only child, and I was
so well looked after that I caught neither a
Scotch nor an American nor even a Lancashire
accent; for later, between visits to the United
States, we lived in Manchester. There, after
leaving school, I served an apprenticeship in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>the works of the Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company. I inherited in some
degree a love of and an instinct for engineering
from my father, one of the best mechanical engineers
I have ever met. He helped to develop
this instinct by encouraging me in everything
I undertook, and by making me profit by the results
of his experience.</p>

<p>In the works I was for a time a workman
among workmen&mdash;a condition of life which is
the best possible beginning for an embryo engineer.
I found my associates of the workshop
good companions, useful instructors and incorrigible
jokers. My father's warnings, however,
saved me from hours of waiting in the forge, at
their direction, while a "straight hook" or a
"putting-on tool" was made, and from hunting
the shops for the "spare short-circuit."</p>

<p>I was congratulating myself on making good
headway and, in articles accepted by various
technical journals, was even telling my elders
all about engineering, when the outbreak of war
changed all my plans and hopes, and interfered
with the career I had mapped out for myself.
In fact, I was in exactly the same position as
many thousands of other young men at the beginning
of their careers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>Although, of American parentage and possessing
American citizenship, I had not the patience
to wait for the entry into the war of the
United States. With an English friend I enlisted
in the British University and Public
Schools battalion, when it was formed in September,
1914. And, although at the time I had
no more notion of it than of becoming President
of the League of Nations, that was my first
step towards the transatlantic flight.</p>

<p>Those were wonderful days for all concerned
in the early training of our battalion at Epsom.
In knowledge of drill our officers started level
with us. Several times I saw a private step
from the ranks, produce from his pocket the
Infantry Training Manual, and show a lieutenant
where he had gone wrong. Doubtful discipline,
perhaps&mdash;but excellent practice, for most
of the original privates of the U.P.S. soon became
officers of the New Army.</p>

<p>I was gazetted a second lieutenant of the
Manchester Regiment in January, 1915, and
with it saw service in the trenches before Ypres
and on the Somme. Then came the second step
towards the transatlantic flight. I had always
longed to be in the air, and I obtained a transfer
to the Royal Flying Corps as an observer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>I had the good fortune to be posted to No. 2
Squadron, under Major (now General) Becke.
While in this unit I first experienced the mixed
sensations of being shot down. One day my
pilot and I were carrying out artillery observation
over Vendin la Vielle when, at a height of
8,000 feet, two anti-aircraft shells set our machine
on fire. Somehow, the pilot managed to
bring down his craft in the British lines; but in
landing it tripped over some telephone wires
and turned a somersault, still blazing at various
points. We were thrown out, but escaped with
a few burns and bruises.</p>

<p>After a short rest in England I returned to
the squadron. I soon left it for good, however.
One dull, snowy day a bullet perforated the
petrol tank of the machine in which, with Lieut.
Medlicott, I was reconnoitering behind the enemy
lines. As a result we were unable to reach
the British zone. We landed in occupied territory;
and I knew the deadly heart-sickness
which comes to all prisoners of war during the
first few days of their captivity.</p>

<p>I was repatriated after being a prisoner of
war in Germany for fourteen months, followed
by nine months in Switzerland. Medlicott,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>meanwhile, made thirteen determined but unsuccessful
bids for escape before being murdered
by the Germans in 1918, while indulging
in a fourteenth attempt.</p>

<p>My two years of captivity constituted, strange
to say, the third step towards the transatlantic
flight; for it was as a prisoner of war that I
first found time to begin a careful study of the
possibilities of aërial navigation. This I continued
after returning to London, where, at the
Ministry of Munitions, I was employed in the
production of the larger aëro-engines.</p>

<p>When, soon after the armistice, the ban on
attempts to fly the Atlantic was lifted, I hoped
that my studies of aërial navigation might be
useful to one of the firms who were preparing
for such a flight. Each one I approached, however,
refused my proposals, and for the moment
I gave up the idea.</p>

<p>It was entirely by chance that I became involved
in the transatlantic competition. One
day I visited the works at Weybridge of Messrs.
Vickers. While I was talking with the superintendent,
Captain Alcock walked into the office.
We were introduced, and in the course of
conversation the competition was mentioned. I
then learned, for the first time, that Messrs.
Vickers were considering an entry, although not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>courting publicity until they should have attempted
it.</p>

<p>I sat up and began to take notice, and ventured
to put forward my views on the navigation
of aircraft for long flights over the sea.
These were received favorably, and the outcome
of the fortunate meeting was that Messrs. Vickers
retained me to act as aërial navigator.</p>

<p>I soon learned to have every confidence in
the man who was to be my pilot. He flew for
years before the war, and he had a magnificent
record for long-distance flying when engaged in
bombing Constantinople and other parts of Turkey,
with the detachments of the Royal Naval
Air Service in the Eastern Mediterranean. His
recent death in a flying accident took from aviation
one of its most able, experienced and
courageous pilots, and robbed his many friends
of a splendid man.</p>

<p>We set to work, and, with every assistance
from the Air Ministry, and the Admiralty, we
soon had our apparatus and instruments ready
for shipment to Newfoundland. Besides our
two selves the Vickers transatlantic party consisted
of ten other men from the works, and a
specialist on Rolls-Royce aëro-engines.</p>

<p>Alcock and I sailed from Southampton on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><i>Mauretania</i>, on board of which its commander&mdash;Captain
Rostron&mdash;made me free of his
bridge, and, as a widely experienced navigator,
gave me much good advice. The Vickers-Vimy
machine, with all stores, left later by a freight
boat.</p>

<p>From Halifax, Nova Scotia, we proceeded to
Port aux Basques, and thence by way of the
Reid Newfoundland Railway to St. John's.
There, we joined the merry and hopeful company
of British aviators who, long before we
arrived, had been preparing for an attempt to
win Lord Northcliffe's prize.</p>

<p>That four of them did not forestall us was
due in part to very bad luck, and in part to their
whole-hearted patriotism. They wanted for
their country the honor of the first transatlantic
flight, whether non-stop or otherwise; and, being
unable to continue the wearisome wait for
good weather in face of the news that the American
flying boat <i>N. C. 4</i> had reached the Azores,
they made their attempt under conditions that
were definitely unfavorable. Fate tripped up
Raynham and Morgan at the start, when they
tried to take their heavily-laden machine into
the air while running over a too short space of
uneven ground, with the wind crossways to it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Fate allowed Hawker and Grieve a rather
longer run, but brought about their fall when
they were half-way to success, owing to a mishap
which, though trifling, had the same effect
as a vital breakage.</p>

<p>It is superfluous, at this time of day, to offer
public sympathy to such gallant competitors;
but I seize the opportunity of expressing admiration
for their splendid effort, and for the
spirit that prompted it. To Hawker and
Grieve we owed particular thanks in that we
profited to a certain extent by what we learned
from the cabled reports of their experiences.
For Grieve, as an expert on aërial navigation,
I have the deepest respect, and I am in full accord
with his views and theories on this, my own
subject.</p>

<p>The same sort of odds against accident that
sent them into the sea might well have befallen
Alcock and me. But it did not; and our freedom
from it was an important factor in our
good fortune. Others were the excellence of
the Vickers-Vimy machine and the Rolls-Royce
engine. Whatever credit is ours should be
shared with them, and with Mr. R. E. Pierson,
E.Sc., M.I.C.E., the designer of the Vickers-Vimy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>We have realized that our flight was but a
solitary fingerpost to the air-traffic&mdash;safe, comfortable
and voluminous&mdash;that in a few years
will pass above the Atlantic Ocean; and even
had the winning of the competition brought us
no other benefits, each of us would have remained
well content to be pioneers of this aërial
entente which is destined to play such an important
part in the political and commercial
friendship between Great Britain and America.</p>

<p>"Hawker left this afternoon."</p>

<p>This message was shouted by a chance-met
motorist, who held up our own car as we
were driving back to St. John's from Ferryland
on the evening of May the eighteenth, after
an unsuccessful search for an aërodrome site.</p>

<p>"And Raynham?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Machine smashed before he could get it off
the ground."</p>

<p>We thanked the stranger for his news, and
passed on to hear further details at the Cochrane
Hotel, which was the headquarters of the
several transatlantic flight contingents at St.
John's. We had rather expected the Sopwith
and Martinsyde parties to make an attempt on
the eighteenth, although the conditions were
definitely unfavorable. The news of the
American <i>N. C. 4's</i> arrival at the Azores had
spurred them to the great adventure, despite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>the weather. The United States flying boats
were not competing for the <i>Daily Mail</i> prize;
but Hawker and Grieve wanted to gain for
Great Britain the honor of being the first to
cross the Atlantic by air. The outcome of this
ambition was the gallant effort that ended in
the sea, half-way to Ireland.</p>

<p>While exceedingly sorry for Raynham, we
were glad that Hawker had started, after his
weeks of weary waiting, and we wished him all
success; for with one exception there was the
best possible feeling among the small colony of
British aviators who had congregated at St.
John's for the transatlantic competition. In
any case, if Hawker succeeded and we no longer
had a chance of winning the prize, we meant
to demonstrate the high qualities of the Vickers-Vimy
machine by flying from Newfoundland
to Ireland.</p>

<p>We had arrived at St. John's early on the
morning of May the thirteenth, being only
twelve hours late on a scheduled time of twenty-seven
hours for the journey from Port aux
Basques. Thirteen, by the way, we regarded
as our lucky number. The construction of our
transatlantic machine was begun on February
thirteenth, it was number thirteen of its class,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and it reached Newfoundland on May twenty-sixth
(twice thirteen). Our party, with the mechanics,
totaled thirteen, and we arrived at St.
John's on May thirteenth. Later we were disappointed
at having to postpone the getaway
until June fourteenth, instead of leaving on
June thirteenth.</p>

<p>We hired a car, and, driving to Mount Pearl,
began what was to be a long and difficult hunt
for any kind of a field that could be improvised
into an aërodrome. The uneven countryside
through which we passed held out no hopes; and
the company we met that evening at the Cochrane
Hotel (Hawker, Grieve, Raynham, Morgan,
and various officials and newspaper correspondents)
were unanimous in declaring that
the only suitable patches of ground had been
appropriated, and that we should find no others
near St. John's.</p>

<p>The American flying boats were at Trepassey,
ready to start for the Azores, and most of
the American correspondents had left St.
John's to visit them. The United States airship
<i>N. C. 5</i> had flown to St. John's some days
before our arrival. She came in a fog, after
wandering over the neighborhood of Newfoundland
for some hours, having lost herself, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
reported, owing to an error of 180° in the directional
wireless bearings given her. She attracted
large crowds, ourselves among them,
to the bay. Later, we saw the airship steering
an erratic course through the Gap, and mentally
wished her commander good luck in his
transatlantic ambitions. Soon afterwards we
heard of her unfortunate break-away and total
loss.</p>

<p>The departure of the N. C. flying boats sent
great excitement into the small company of
Britishers at the Cochrane Hotel. Hawker,
Grieve, Raynham and Morgan discarded caution,
and on hearing of the <i>N. C. 4's</i> arrival at
the Azores risked exceedingly their chances of
success by agreeing to start immediately, in a
whole-hearted and plucky effort to gain for
Great Britain the honor of the first flight across
the Atlantic. The result was immediate disaster
for Raynham and Morgan, whose small aërodrome
was altogether unsuitable for a "take
off" into the then wind, and magnificent failure
for Hawker and Grieve, owing to a minor
mishap to their engine.</p>

<p>Soon after the flight of the American craft,
I met Commander Byrd, U. S. N., designer of
the bubble sextant for aërial navigation that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
bears his name. We had an interesting talk
on the problems and difficulties of aërial navigation,
and I tried to secure from Washington
a Byrd sextant. The United States Naval authorities
promised to forward one from Washington;
but unfortunately, owing to transport
difficulties, it reached St. John's after our departure.
Nevertheless I am deeply grateful to
the United States Navy Department for its
courtesy and its offer of help in an enterprise
that was foreign to them and non-official.</p>

<p>Newfoundland is a hospitable place, but its
best friends cannot claim that it is ideal for
aviation. The whole of the island has no
ground that might be made into a first-class
aërodrome. The district around St. John's is
especially difficult. Some of the country is
wooded, but for the most part it shows a rolling,
switchback surface, across which aëroplanes
cannot taxi with any degree of smoothness.
The soil is soft and dotted with bowlders,
for only a light layer of it covers the rock
stratum. Another handicap is the prevalence
of thick fogs, which roll westward from the sea.</p>

<p>For about a week we continued the quest for
a landing-ground, and we must have driven over
hundreds of miles of very bad road. Growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>tired of hiring cars, we bought a second-hand
Buick which registered a total mileage of four
hundred miles at the time of purchase. Before
long we were convinced that the speedometer
must have been disconnected previous to the
final forty thousand miles.</p>

<p>The best possibilities for an aërodrome that
we could find were several level strips of meadowland,
about a hundred yards wide by three
hundred long; whereas the Vickers-Vimy, fully
loaded, might need five hundred yards of clear
run into the wind. Meanwhile, although disappointment
accompanied us all over Newfoundland,
the pacing out of fields provided good exercise.</p>

<p>The evenings were mostly spent in playing
cards with the other competitors at the Cochrane
Hotel, or in visits to the neighboring film
theaters. St. John's itself showed us every
kindness. We explored the town pretty thoroughly,
and were soon able to recognize parts
of it with eyes closed and nostrils open; for
its chief occupation appeared to be the drying
of very dead cod.</p>

<p>Having heard rumors that suitable ground
might be found at Ferryland, we motored there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
on May the eighteenth, and it was while returning
from yet another disappointment that
we learned of Hawker's disappearance into the
Atlantic mists. Excitement and anxiety about
the possible fate of Hawker and Grieve spread
all the world over; but nowhere was it more
intense than among us at the Cochrane Hotel,
who had shared their hopes and discussed their
plans. We were a gloomy crowd indeed until
St. John's heard the sensational story of their
rescue.</p>

<p>Raynham, meanwhile, although very disappointed
after the setback that damaged his machine,
kept alight the candle of hope and the
torch of determination. Before it was possible
to know whether or not Hawker had succeeded,
he made arrangements for repair and
decided to try again. He also invited Alcock
and me to use his ground for erecting the Vickers-Vimy.
A similar invitation was given by
Captain Fenn, now in charge of the Sopwith
party.</p>

<p>Neither aërodrome would be suitable for our
final "take off"; but we accepted Raynham's
very sporting offer, and arranged to build up
the Vickers-Vimy, which was expected to arrive
any day, on his aërodrome at Quidi Vidi, while
continuing the search for a more suitable field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>Our mechanics arrived with machine and engines
on May the twenty-sixth, and we set to
work at once on its erection. This was carried
out in the open air, amid many obstacles and
with much improvization, sheerlegs for example,
being constructed out of scaffolding poles.
Raynham let us use his hangar as a store.</p>

<p>All the Vickers party worked hard and cheerfully
from early dawn until dark, each man
being on strenuous duty from twelve to fourteen
hours a day. Two mechanics remained on
guard each night, while the remainder drove
about three miles to their billets.</p>

<p>During the whole of this period of a thousand
and one difficulties, each mechanic gave of his
best, and I cannot pay too high a tribute to those
men who labored for us so competently and
painstakingly, and yet received none of the
glory. Even those who were but indirectly concerned
in the venture searched for opportunities
of helping us. The reporters representing
the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the New York <i>Times</i>, and the
New York <i>World</i> were often of assistance when
extra man-power was required. But for one
of the American reporters&mdash;Mr. Klauber&mdash;we
should have been obliged to start without an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>electric torch when our own failed at the last
moment.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a nerve-edging time until the
machine approached completion. Each day
produced some new difficulty. Alcock kept his
head and his temper admirably, however, and
his intelligent supervision of the mechanics'
work was an effective insurance against loss
of time.</p>

<p>As the parts of the Vickers-Vimy grew into
the semblance of a complete aëroplane it attracted
more and more visitors. Many rubbernecks,
who seemed to have no other occupation,
spent hours in leaning on the nearest fence and
watching us. Soon we found it necessary to
build a temporary enclosure round the machine.
Even that did not keep the curious at a distance.
We remained unworried so long as the crowd
contented itself with just watching; but the visitors
forced us to take special precautions
against damage. The testing of the fabric's
firmness with the point of an umbrella was a
favorite pastime of theirs, and more than once
we dispersed small parties whom we found leaning
against the trailing-edges, much as Australian
soldiers on leave from France used to
lean against the lamp-posts of the Strand. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>man held his lighted cigar against a wing, and
was quite annoyed when asked to keep at a distance.</p>

<p>We were still unsuccessful in our search for
an aërodrome. One day a telegram arrived
from a landowner in Harbor Grace, offering
what he called an ideal field. Alcock raced off
to inspect and secure it; but when he returned
in the evening his one-sided grin told me that
we were still out of luck. "The ideal aërodrome"
was a meadow about one hundred and
fifty by three hundred yards&mdash;and the price demanded
for its hire was twenty-five thousand
dollars plus the cost of getting it ready and an
indemnity for all damage. Land <i>sells</i> in Newfoundland
at thirty-five cents an acre.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a local inhabitant&mdash;Mr. Lester,
who had done all our carting&mdash;offered us
a field under more reasonable conditions, at a
place called Monday's Pool. We found it to be
a large meadow, half on a hill and with a swamp
at the bottom. It possessed, nevertheless, a
level surface of about three hundred yards, running
east and west.</p>

<p>We examined and paced out four other fields
on the hilltop, and found that by taking them
in we could obtain a full run of five hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>yards. The owners of this additional ground
wanted extortionate prices for its use, but after
much haggling we closed a deal with them.</p>

<p>Thirty laborers, with pick and shovel, set to
work to prepare the aërodrome by removing
hillocks, blasting bowlders and leveling walls
and fences. Finally it was completed, well
within the time for the trial flight.</p>

<p>During the first few days spent on the erecting
of the machine there was little for me to do.
I unpacked and verified wireless and navigation
equipment, and having rigged up a receiving
station on the roof of the Cochrane Hotel, with
the consent and help of Lieut. Clare, of the
Mount Pearl Naval Wireless Station, I practiced
the sending and receiving of wireless messages,
and tuning in on various wave-lengths.</p>

<p>Rain and high wind caused a delay of three
days, during which the machine necessarily remained
in the open, with tarpaulins over the
engines and only a small windscreen to break
the force of the gales. When better conditions
arrived the body of the Vickers-Vimy grew
slowly into the semblance of a complete aëroplane,
spurred thereto by our impatience and
the willing work of the mechanics. The wings
being in place, the Rolls-Royce experts became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>busy, examining and checking every little detail
of their motors, so that there should be no
avoidable trouble on that account. Water for
the radiator was filtered, and then boiled in a
steel barrel.</p>

<p>Our day-to-day watchers from St. John's
showed much interest in this boiling process,
and asked many questions. They seemed content
with our explanation that we were boiling
the gasoline so as to remove all water. Several
asked whether we filled the planes with gas to
make them lighter. Others were disappointed
because we did not intend to drop our undercarriage
over the sea, as Hawker had done, and
prophesied that such neglect would lead to failure.</p>

<p>The machine was ready to take the air on
the morning of Monday, June the ninth, and
we decided to make the first flight that same
afternoon. We had meant to keep the news of
the forthcoming trial as secret as possible, so
as to avoid a crowd. It leaked out, however,
and long before the engines were warmed up
and tested a large gathering had collected at
Quidi Vidi.</p>

<p>The weather was on its best behavior, and
our "take off" from the ground was perfect in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>every way. Under Alcock's skillful hands the
big Vimy became almost as nippy as a single-seater
scout. We headed directly westward,
passing over the sea for some fifteen minutes.
It was a clear day, and the sea reflected the
sky's vivid blue. Near the coast it was streaked
and spotted by the glistening white of icebergs
and the evanescent appearances and disappearances
of white-caps.</p>

<p>Trial observation with my navigation instruments
proved them to be O. K.; but not a spark
could be conjured from the wireless apparatus.
The machine and motors seemed in perfect
condition.</p>

<p>Alcock turned the Vickers-Vimy, and brought
us back over St. John's at a height of four thousand
feet. Newfoundland from above looked
even more bleak and rugged than it did from
the ground; and we saw that landing grounds
would be impossible on the eastern side of it.</p>

<p>We were to descend on the new aërodrome,
which we picked out by means of a smudge-fire,
lighted as a signal. Alcock made a perfect
landing, in an uphill direction. The Vimy ran
on, topped the brow, and was heading straight
for a fence on the roadside; but the pilot saved
a collision by opening up the starboard engine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>which swung the craft round before she came
to a standstill.</p>

<p>We pushed the machine down the hill to the
most sheltered part of the field, pegged it down,
and roped off a space round it, to keep spectators
at a safe distance. The proposed hangar
was unfinished, so that the Vickers-Vimy still
remained in the open.</p>

<p>I dismounted the wireless generator for examination,
and next day took it to Mount Pearl
Wireless Station, where Lieut. Clare helped me
to locate the fault and to remedy it.</p>

<p>A far more serious worry now confronted us.
The fuel we had intended to carry was a mixture
of gasoline and benzol, sent from England.
On examination we found in it a peculiar precipitate,
like a very soft resin. It was sticky,
and had the consistency of India rubber wetted
with gasoline; but when dry it reduced to a
powder. Naturally we could not afford the
risk of letting such a deposit clog our filters
and perhaps, owing to stoppage of fuel supply,
cause motor failure&mdash;that bugbear of every
aviator who flies over long distances.</p>

<p>It was not definitely proved that the precipitate
resulted from the mixture of gasoline and
benzol; but so much depended on satisfactory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>fuel that we dared use none that was doubtful,
and we decided to substitute pure gasoline for
the mixture. The problem was how to find
enough of the quality required&mdash;Shell B.
Raynham, as much of a sportsman as ever, put
his spare stock at our disposal; but fortunately
a newly arrived ship brought enough for our
needs.</p>

<p>Mr. P. Maxwell Muller, who had organized
our transatlantic party, also came on this boat.
He is a rabid optimist, with the power of infecting
others with his hopefulness; and we
were glad indeed to see him, and especially to
turn over to him such things as unpaid bills.</p>

<p>The second trial flight took place on June
the twelfth. Once again everything except the
wireless apparatus was satisfactory. The
transmitter worked well for a short time, but
afterwards the insulation on a small transformer
in the transmitter failed, giving me a
violent shock. After a short time in the air,
Alcock made another satisfactory landing.</p>

<p>By now we were besieging Lieutenant Clements,
the meteorological officer, for weather reports.
Besides his own work he had now undertaken
the duties of Major Partridge, official
starter for the Royal Aëro Club of London. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>such he had to place the club's official seal on
the Vickers-Vimy. This he did without any
superfluous ceremony, his seal insuring that we
should not cheat by flying from Newfoundland
in one aëroplane and landing on Ireland in another.</p>

<p>At that period the weather reports, such as
they were, indicated fairly favorable conditions
for the flight, and we prepared to make the attempt
immediately. At no time were the reports
complete, however, owing to the delays
in transmission; although Clements made the
very best of the meager data at his disposal.</p>

<p>We saw the Handley-Page carrying out its
initial flights; but we hoped to leave on Friday,
June the thirteenth, and thus show it the way
across the Atlantic. We worked at high speed
on several last-minute jobs. The compasses
were swung, the wireless apparatus repaired,
more elastic shock-absorbers were wrapped
round the axles, the navigating instruments
were taken on board, with food and emergency
supplies.</p>

<p>But with all the hurry and bustle we found
that everything could not be ready by Friday
the thirteenth, and that a postponement until
4 A. M. on the Saturday was essential.</p>

<p>By Friday evening the last coat of dope was
dry, and nothing had been overlooked. The
only articles missing were some life-saving
suits, which we were expecting from the United
States. Long afterwards we discovered that
these had been delivered to the Bank of Montreal,
where the officials, believing that the case
contained typewriters, stored it in their cellars.</p>

<p>Alcock and I went to bed at 7 P. M. on Friday
while the mechanics remained all night with
the machine, completing the filling of the tanks
and moving it to the position chosen for the
start. We were called before dawn, and joined
them on the aërodrome at 3:30 A. M. on June
the fourteenth.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Start</small></span><br /><br /></h2>


<p>A large black cat, its tail held high in a
comical curve, sauntered by the transatlantic
machine as we stood by it, early in the
morning; and such a cheerful omen made me
more than ever anxious to start.</p>

<p>Two other black cats&mdash;more intimate if less
alive&mdash;waited in the Vickers-Vimy. They were
Lucky Jim and Twinkletoe, our mascots, destined
to be the first air passengers across the
Atlantic. Lucky Jim wore an enormous head,
an untidy ribbon and a hopeful expression;
whereas Twinkletoe was daintily diminutive,
and, from the tip of her upright tail to the tip
of her stuffed nose, expressed surprise and
anxiety. Other gifts that we carried as evidence
of our friends' best wishes were bunches
of white heather.</p>

<p>"Strong westerly wind. Conditions otherwise
fairly favorable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>Such was the brief summary of the weather
conditions given us at 4 A. M. by the meteorological
officer. We had definitely decided to
leave on the fourteenth, if given half a chance;
for at all costs we wanted to avoid a long period
of hope deferred while awaiting ideal conditions.</p>

<p>At early dawn we were on the aërodrome,
searching the sky for a sign and asking information
of Lieutenant Clements, the Royal Air
Force weather expert. His reports were fairly
favorable; but a hefty cross-wind was blowing
from the west in uneven gusts, and everybody
opined that we had better wait a few hours, in
the expectation that it would die down.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alcock ran the engines and found
them to be in perfect condition. Neither could
any fault be found with the gray-winged machine,
inert but fully loaded, and complete to
the last split-pin.</p>

<p>It was of the Standard type of Vickers-Vimy
bomber; although, of course, bombs and bombing
gear were not carried, their weight being
usefully replaced by extra storage tanks for
gasoline. One of these, shaped like a boat,
could be used as a life-saving raft if some accident
brought about a descent into the sea. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>tank was so placed that it would be the first
to be emptied of gasoline. The fittings allowed
of its detachment, ready for floating, while the
machine lost height in a glide. We hoped for
and expected the best; but it was as well to be
prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>To make communication and coöperation
more easy, the seats for both pilot and navigator
were side by side in what is usually the
pilot's cockpit, the observer's cockpit at the
fore-end of the fuselage being hidden under a
stream-lined covering and occupied by a tank.</p>

<p>The tanks had been filled during the night, so
that the Vickers-Vimy contained its full complement
of eight hundred and seventy gallons of
gasoline and forty gallons of oil. We now
packed our personal luggage, which consisted
only of toilet kit and food&mdash;sandwiches, Caley's
chocolate, Horlick's Malted Milk, and two
thermos flasks filled with coffee. A small cupboard,
fitted into the tail, contained emergency
rations. These were for use in case of disaster,
as the tail of the aëroplane would remain clear
of the waves for a long while after the nose
had submerged. Our mascots, also, were in
this cupboard.</p>

<p>The mail-bag had been taken on board a day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>earlier. It contained three hundred private letters,
for each of which the postal officials at St.
John's had provided a special stamp. For
one of these stamps, by the way, eight hundred
and seventy-five dollars was offered and refused
on the Manchester Exchange within two
days of the letter's delivery. They are now
sold at about one hundred and twenty-five dollars
apiece, I believe.</p>

<p>We breakfasted, and throughout the morning
waited for a weakening of the wind. As, however,
it remained at about the same strength
and showed no signs of better behavior, we
made up our minds to leave at mid-day.</p>

<p>We had planned to get away in an easterly
direction, for although we should thus be moving
with the wind instead of into it, the machine
would face down-hill, and owing to the shape
of the aërodrome we should have a better run
than if we taxied towards the west. The
Vickers-Vimy was therefore placed in position
to suit these arrangements.</p>

<p>But soon we found that the gale was too
strong for such a plan, and that we should have
to "take off" into it. The mechanics dragged
the machine to the far end of the aërodrome,
so as to prepare for a westerly run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>This change was responsible for a minor setback.
A sudden gust carried a drag-rope
round the undercarriage, tightened one of the
wheels against a petrol supply pipe, and
crushed it. The consequent replacement wasted
about an hour.</p>

<p>Still with hopes that the gale would drop during
the early afternoon, we sat under the wing-tips
at two o'clock and lunched, while conscious
of an earnest hope that the next square meal
would be eaten in Ireland.</p>

<p>The wind remaining obstinately strong during
the early afternoon, we agreed to take
things as they were and to lose no more precious
time. At about four o'clock we wriggled
into our flying-kit, and climbed into the machine.
We wore electrically heated clothing, Burberry
overalls, and the usual fur gloves and fur-lined
helmets.</p>

<p>While Alcock attended to his engines I made
certain that my navigation instruments were in
place. The sextant was clipped to the dashboard
facing the pilot, the course and distance
calculator was clasped to the side of the fuselage,
the drift-indicator fitted under my seat,
and the Baker navigation machine, with my
charts inside it, lay on the floor of the cockpit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>I also carried an electric torch, and kept within
easy reach a Very pistol, with red and white
flares, so that if the worst should happen we
could attract the attention of passing ships.
The battery for heating our electric suits was
between the two seats.</p>

<p>The meteorological officer gave me a chart
showing the approximate strength and direction
of the Atlantic air currents. It indicated
that the high westerly wind would drop before
we were a hundred miles out to sea, and that
the wind velocities for the rest of the journey
would not exceed twenty knots, with clear
weather over the greater part of the ocean.
This was responsible for satisfactory hopes at
the time of departure; but later, when we were
over mid-Atlantic, the hopes dissolved in disappointment
when the promised "clear
weather" never happened.</p>

<p>The departure was quiet and undramatic.
Apart from the mechanics and a few reporters,
few people were present, for the strong wind
had persuaded our day-to-day sightseers from
St. John's that we must postpone a start.
When all was ready I shook hands with Lieutenant
Clements, Mr. Maxwell Muller and other
friends, accepted their best wishes for success,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>and composed myself in the rather crowded
cockpit.</p>

<p>The customary signal-word "Contact!" exchanged
between pilot and mechanics, seemed,
perhaps, to have a special momentary significance;
but my impatience to take the plunge and
be rid of anxiety about the start shut out all
other impressions that might have been different
from those experienced at the beginning of
each of the thousand and one flights I had made
before the transatlantic venture.</p>

<p>First one and then the other motors came to
life, swelled into a roar when Alcock ran them
up and softened into a subdued murmur when
he throttled back and warmed them up. Finally,
everything being satisfactory, he disconnected
the starting magneto and engine
switches, to avoid stoppage due to possible
short-circuits, and signaled for the chocks to
be pulled clear. With throttles open and engines
"all out," the Vickers-Vimy advanced
into the westerly wind.</p>

<p>The "take off," up a slight gradient, was
very difficult. Gusts up to forty-five knots
were registered, and there was insufficient room
to begin the run dead into the wind. What I
feared in particular was that a sudden eddy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>might lift the planes on one side and cause the
machine to heel over. Another danger was
the rough surface of the aërodrome.</p>

<p>Owing to its heavy load, the machine did not
leave the ground until it had lurched and lumbered,
at an ever-increasing speed, over 300
yards. We were then almost at the end of the
ground-tether allowed us.</p>

<p>A line of hills straight ahead was responsible
for much "bumpiness" in the atmosphere, and
made climbing very difficult. At times the
strong wind dropped almost to zero, then rose
in eddying blasts. Once or twice our wheels
nearly touched the ground again.</p>

<p>Under these conditions we could climb but
slowly, allowing for the danger of sudden upward
gusts. Several times I held my breath,
from fear that our undercarriage would hit a
roof or a tree-top.</p>

<p>I am convinced that only Alcock's clever
piloting saved us from such an early disaster.
When, after a period that seemed far longer
than it actually was, we were well above the
buildings and trees, I noticed that the perspiration
of acute anxiety was running down his
face.</p>

<p>We wasted no time and fuel in circling round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>the aërodrome while attaining a preliminary
height, but headed straight into the wind until
we were at about eight hundred feet. Then
we turned towards the sea and continued to rise
leisurely, with engines throttled down. As we
passed our aërodrome I leaned over the side of
the machine and waved farewell to the small
groups of mechanics and sightseers.</p>

<p>The Vickers-Vimy, although loaded to the
extent of about eleven pounds per square foot,
climbed satisfactorily, if slowly. Eight minutes
passed before we had reached the thousand feet
level.</p>

<p>As we passed over St. John's and Cabot's
Hill towards Concepcion Bay the air was very
bumpy, and not until we reached the coast and
were away from the uneven contours of Newfoundland
did it become calmer. The eddying
wind, which was blowing behind us from almost
due west, with a strength of thirty-five knots,
made it harder than ever to keep the machine
on a straight course. The twin-engine Vickers-Vimy
is not especially sensitive to atmospheric
instability; but under the then atmospheric conditions
it lurched, swayed, and did its best to
deviate, much as if it had been a little single-seater
scout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>We crossed the coast at 4:28 P. M. (Greenwich
time), our aneroid then registering about
twelve hundred feet. Just before we left the
land I let out the wireless aërial, and tapped out
on the transmitter key a message to Mount
Pearl Naval Station: "All well and started."</p>

<p>My mind merely recorded the fact that we
were leaving Newfoundland behind us. Otherwise
it was too tense with concentration on the
task ahead to find room for any emotions or
thoughts on seeing the last of the square-patterned
roof-mosaic of St. John's, and of the
tangled intricacy of Newfoundland's fields,
woods and hills. Behind and below was America,
far ahead and below was Europe, between
the two were nearly two thousand miles of
ocean. But at the time I made no such stirring,
if obvious, reflections; for my navigation instruments
and charts, as applied to sun, horizon,
sea-surface and time of day, demanded
close and undivided attention.</p>

<p>Withal, I felt a queer but quite definite confidence
in our safe arrival over the Irish coast,
based, I suppose, on an assured knowledge that
the machine, the motors, the navigating instruments
and the pilot were all first-class.</p>

<p>The Vickers-Vimy shook itself free from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>atmospheric disturbances over the land, and
settled into an even stride through the calmer
spaces above the ocean. The westerly wind
behind us, added to the power developed by the
motors, gave us a speed along our course (as
opposed to "air-speed") of nearly one hundred
and forty knots.</p>

<p>Visibility was fairly good during the first
hour of the flight. Above, at a height of something
between two and three thousand feet, a
wide ceiling of clouds was made jagged at
fairly frequent intervals by holes through which
the blue sky could be glimpsed. Below, the sea
was blue-gray, dull for the most part but bright
in occasional patches, where the sunlight
streamed on it through some cloud-gap. Icebergs
stood out prominently from the surface,
in splashes of glaring white.</p>

<p>I was using all my faculties in setting and
keeping to the prescribed course. The Baker
navigating machine, with the chart, was on my
knees. Not knowing what kind of weather was
before us, I knelt on my seat and made haste to
take observations on the sea, the horizon, and
the sun, through intervals in the covering of
clouds.</p>

<p>The navigation of aircraft, in its present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>stage, is distinctly more difficult than the navigation
of seacraft. The speed at which they
travel and the influence of the wind introduce
problems which are not easily solved.</p>

<p>A ship's navigator knows to a small fraction
of a mile the set of any ocean current, and from
the known speed of his vessel he can keep "dead
reckoning" with an accuracy that is nearly
absolute. In fact, navigators have taken their
craft across the Atlantic without once having
seen the sun or stars, and yet, at the end of
the journey, been within five miles of the desired
destination. But in the air the currents
either cannot be, or have not yet been, charted,
and his allowance for the drift resulting from
them must be obtained by direct observation on
the surface of the ocean.</p>

<p>By the same means his actual speed over the
ocean may be calculated. He finds the position
of his craft by measuring the angle which either
the sun or a selected star makes with the horizon,
and noting the Greenwich mean time at
which the observation is made. If the bearings
of two distinct wireless stations can be taken,
it is also possible to find his definite position
by means of directional wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>When making my plans for the transatlantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>flight I considered very carefully all the possibilities,
and decided to rely solely upon observations
of the sun and stars and upon "dead
reckoning," in preference to using directional
wireless, as I was uncertain at that time whether
or not the directional wireless system was sufficiently
reliable.</p>

<p>My sextant was of the ordinary marine type,
but it had a more heavily engraved scale than
is usual, so as to make easier the reading of it
amid the vibration of the aëroplane. My main
chart was on the Mercator projection, and I had
a special transparent chart which could be
moved above it, and upon which were drawn the
Sumner circles for all times of the day. I carried
a similar special chart for use at night,
giving the Sumner circles for six chosen stars.
To measure the drift I had a six-inch Drift-Bearing
plate, which also permitted me to measure
the ground speed, with the help of a stopwatch.
In addition, I had an Appleyard Course
and Distance Calculator, and Traverse tables
for the calculation of "dead reckoning."</p>

</div>




<p>As the horizon is often obscured by clouds or
mist, making impossible the measurement of
its angle with the heavenly bodies, I had a
special type of spirit level, on which the horizon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>was replaced by a bubble. This, of course, was
less reliable than a true horizon since the bubble
was affected by variations of speed; but it was
at least a safeguard. Taking into account the
general obscurity of the atmosphere during
most of the flight, it was fortunate that I took
such a precaution, for I seldom caught sight
of a clearly defined horizon.</p>

<p>I could legitimately congratulate myself on
having collected as many early observations as
possible while the conditions were good; for
soon we ran into an immense bank of fog, which
shut off completely the surface of the ocean.
The blue of the sea merged into a hazy purple,
and then into the dullest kind of gray.</p>

<p>The cloud screen above us, also, grew much
thicker, and there were no more gaps in it.
The occasional sun-glints on wing-tips and
struts no longer appeared.</p>

<p>Thus I could obtain neither observations on
the sun, nor calculations of drift from the seas.
Assuming that my first observations were satisfactory,
I therefore carried on by "dead
reckoning," and hoped for the best. From time
to time I varied the course slightly, so as to
allow for the different variations of the compass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>Meantime, while we flew through the wide
layer of air sandwiched between fog and cloud,
I began to jot down remarks for the log of the
journey. At 5:20 I noted that we were at fifteen
hundred feet and still climbing slowly,
while the haze was becoming ever thicker and
heavier.</p>

<p>I leaned towards the wireless transmitter,
and began to send a message; but the small
propeller on it snapped, and broke away from
the generator. Careful examination, both at
the time and after we landed, showed no defect;
and I am still unable to account for the fracture.
Although I was too occupied with calculations
to pay much attention to moods or passing
thoughts, I remember feeling that this cutting
off of all means of communication with the life
below and behind us gave a certain sense of
finality to the adventure.</p>

<p>We continued eastward, with the rhythmic
drone of the motors unnoted in supreme concentration
on the tense hours that were to come.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br /><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>Evening</small></span><br /><br /></h2>


<p>For a time Alcock and I attempted short
conversations through the telephone. Its
earpieces were under our fur caps, and round
our necks were sensitive receivers for transmitting
the throat vibrations that accompany
speech. At about six o'clock Alcock discarded
his earpieces because they were too painful;
and for the rest of the flight we communicated
in gestures and by scribbled notes.</p>

<p>I continued to keep the course by "dead reckoning,"
taking into account height, compass
bearing, strength of wind, and my previous observations.
The wind varied quite a lot, and
several times the nose of the Vickers-Vimy
swayed from the right direction, so that I had
to make rapid mental allowances for deviation.</p>

<p>The results I made known to Alcock by passing
over slips of paper torn from my notebook.
The first of these was the direction: "<i>Keep her
nearer 120 than 140.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>The second supplied the news that the transmitter
was useless: "<i>Wireless generator
smashed. The propeller has gone.</i>"</p>

<p>Throughout the evening we flew between a
covering of unbroken cloud and a screen of thick
fog, which shut off the sea completely. My
scribbled comment to the pilot at 5:45 was:
"<i>I can't get an obs. in this fog. Will estimate
that same wind holds and work by dead reckoning.</i>"</p>

<p>Despite the lack of external guidance, the
early evening was by no means dull. Just after
six the starboard engine startled us with a
loud, rhythmic chattering, rather like the noise
of machine-gun fire at close quarters. With a
momentary thought of the engine trouble which
had caused Hawker and Grieve to descend in
mid-Atlantic, we both looked anxiously for the
defect.</p>

<p>This was not hard to find. A chunk of exhaust
pipe had split away, and was quivering
before the rush of air like a reed in an organ
pipe. It became first red, then white-hot; and,
softened by the heat, it gradually crumpled up.
Finally it was blown away, with the result that
three cylinders were exhausting straight into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>the air, without guidance through the usual outlet.</p>

<p>The chattering swelled into a loud, jerky
thrum, much more prominent than the normal
noise of a Rolls-Royce aëro-engine. This settled
down to a steady and continuous roar.</p>

<p>Until we landed nothing could be done to the
broken exhaust pipe, and we had to accept it
as a minor disaster, unpleasant but irremediable.
Very soon my ears had become so accustomed
to the added clamor that it passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>I must admit, however, that although my
mind contained no room for impressions dealing
with incidents not of vital importance, I was
far from comfortable when I first observed that
a little flame, licking outward from the open exhaust,
was playing on one of the cross-bracing
wires and had made it red-hot. This trouble
could not be lessened by throttling down the
starboard engine, as in that case we should
have lost valuable height.</p>

<p>The insistent hum of the engines, in fact,
made the solitude seem more normal. The long
flight would have been dreadful had we made
it in silence; for, shut off as we were from sea
and sky, it was a very lonely affair. At this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>stage the spreading fog enveloped the Vickers-Vimy
so closely that our sheltered cockpit suggested
an isolated but by no means cheerless
room.</p>

<p>Moisture condensed on goggles, dial glasses
and wires when, at about seven, we rose through
a layer of clouds on the two thousand foot level.
Alcock wore no goggles, by the way, and I
made use of mine only when leaning over the
side of the fuselage to take observations.</p>

<p>Emerging into the air above the clouds, I
looked upward, and found another stretch of
cloud-bank still higher, at five thousand feet.
We thus remained cut off from the sun. Still
guided only by "dead reckoning," the Vickers-Vimy
continued along the airway between a
white cloud-ceiling and a white cloud-carpet.</p>

<p>I was very anxious for an opportunity to take
further observations either of the sun or of the
stars, so as to check the direction by finding
our correct position. At 7:40 I handed Alcock
the following note: "<i>If you get above clouds
we will get a good fix


<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to-night, and hope for
clear weather to-morrow. Not at any risky
expense to engines though. We have four
hours yet to climb.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>The altimeter was then registering three
thousand feet.</p>

<p>All this while I had listened occasionally for
wireless messages, as the receiver was still in
working order. No message came for us, however,
and the only sign of life was when, at 7:40,
I heard somebody calling "B. M. K." Even
that small sign of contact with life below
cheered me mightily.</p>

<p>Throughout the journey we had no regular
meals, but ate and drank in snatches, whenever
we felt so inclined. It was curious that neither
of us felt hungry at any time during the sixteen
hours of the flight, although now and then I
felt the need of something to drink.</p>

<p>The food was packed into a little cupboard
behind my head, on the left-hand side of the
fuselage. I reached for it at about 7:30, and,
deciding that Alcock must need nourishment, I
passed him two sandwiches and some chocolate,
and uncorked the thermos flask. He made use
of only one hand for eating and drinking, keeping
the other on the control lever.</p>

<p>We happened upon a large gap in the upper
layer of clouds at 8:30. Through it the sun
shone pleasantly, projecting the shadow of the
Vickers-Vimy on to the lower layer, over which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>it darted and twisted, contracting or expanding
according to the distortions on the cloud-surface.</p>

<p>I was able to maintain observation on the
sun for some ten minutes. The calculations
thus obtained showed that if we were still on the
right course the machine must be farther east
than was indicated by "dead reckoning."
From this I deduced that the strength of the
wind must have increased rather than fallen off,
as had been prophesied in the report of the
meteorological expert at St. John's. This supposition
was borne out by the buffetings which,
from time to time, swayed the Vickers-Vimy.
Up till then our average speed had been one
hundred and forty-three knots.</p>

<p>I got my observations of the sun while kneeling
on the seat and looking between the port
wings. I made use of the spirit level, as the
horizon was invisible and the sextant could
therefore not be used.</p>

<p>Later, I caught sight of the sea for a few
brief moments, and at 9:15 I wrote the following
note to Alcock: "<i>Through a rather bad
patch I have just made our ground speed 140
knots, and from the sun's altitude we must be
much further east and south than I calculated.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>I continued to keep a log of our movements
and observations, and at 9:20 P. M. made the
following entry: "<i>Height 4,000 feet. Dense
clouds below and above. Got one sun observation,
which shows that dead reckoning is badly
out. Shall wait for stars and climb. At 8:31
position about 49 deg. 31 minutes north, 38 deg.
35 minutes west.</i>"</p>

<p>The clouds above remained constant, at a
height of about five thousand feet. I was eager
to pass through them before the stars appeared;
and at nine-thirty, when the light was fading, I
scribbled the inquiry: "<i>Can you get above these
clouds at, say, 60°? We must get stars as soon
as poss.</i>"</p>

<p>Alcock nodded, and proceeded to climb as
steeply as he dared. Twilight was now setting
in, gradually but noticeably. Between the
layers of cloud the daylight, although never
very good, had until then been strong enough to
let me read the instruments and chart. At
ten o'clock this was impossible without artificial
light.</p>

<p>For my chart I now used an electric lamp. I
switched on a tiny bulb which was placed so as
to make the face of the compass clear in the
dark, all the other fixed instruments being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>luminous in themselves. For my intermittent
inspection of the engines I had to flash the
electric torch over either side of the cockpit.</p>

<p>The clouds, both above and below, grew
denser and darker. One could see them only
as indefinite masses of nebulousness, and it became
more and more difficult to judge how near
to or how far from them we were. An entry in
my log, made at 10:20, says, "<i>No observations,
and dead reckoning apparently out. Could not
get above clouds for sunset. Will wait check
by stars.</i>"</p>

<p>An hour later we had climbed to five thousand
two hundred feet. But still we found clouds
above us; and we continued to rise, so as to be
above them in time for some early observations
on the stars.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark; and as we droned our
isolated way eastward and upward, nothing
could be seen outside the cockpit, except the
inner struts, the engines, the red-glowing vapor
ejected through the exhaust pipes, and portions
of the wings, which glistened in the dim moonglimmer.</p>

<p>I waited impatiently for the first sight of the
moon, the Pole Star, and other night-time
friends of every navigator.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>Night</small></span><br /><br /></h2>


<p>Midnight came and went amid sullen
darkness, modified only by dim moonlight
and the red radiance that spurted from
the motors' exhaust pipes.</p>

<p>By then we must have climbed to about six
thousand feet, although my log shows no record
of our height at this stage. Meanwhile, we
were still between upper and lower ranges of
cloud banks.</p>

<p>At a quarter past twelve Alcock took the
Vickers-Vimy through the upper range, only
to find a third layer of clouds, several thousand
feet higher. This, however, was patchy and
without continuity, so that I was able to glimpse
the stars from time to time.</p>

<p>At 12:25 I identified through a gap to north-eastward
Vega, which shone very brightly high
in the heavens, and the Pole Star. With their
help, and that of a cloud horizon that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>clearly defined in the moonlight, not far below
our level, I used the sextant to fix our position.</p>

<p>This I found was latitude 50° 7´ N. and longitude
31° W., showing that we had flown 850
nautical miles, at an average speed of 106 knots.
We were slightly to the south of the correct
course, which fact I made known to Alcock in a
note, with penciled corrections for remedying
the deviation.</p>

<p>Most of my "dead reckoning" calculations
were short of our actual position because, influenced
by meteorological predictions based on
the weather reports at St. John's, I had allowed
for a falling off in the strength of the wind,
and this had not occurred. Having found the
stars and checked our position and direction,
the urgent necessity to continue climbing no
longer existed. Alcock had been nursing his
engines very carefully, and to reduce the strain
on them he let the machine lose height slowly.
At 1:20 A. M. we were down to four thousand
feet, and an hour later we had dropped yet four
hundred feet lower.</p>

<p class="center"><small>THE TRANSATLANTIC MACHINE&mdash;A VICKERS-VIMY
WITH ROLLS-ROYCE ENGINES</small></p></div>
</div>


<p>The clouds overhead were still patchy, clusters
of stars lightening the intervals between
them. But the Vickers-Vimy, at its then
height, was moving through a sea of fog, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>prevented effective observation. This I made
known to the pilot in a message: "<i>Can get no
good readings. Observation too indefinite.</i>"</p>

<p>The moon was in evidence for about an hour
and a half, radiating a misty glow over the semi-darkness
and tinging the cloud-tips with variations
of silver, gold and soft red. Whenever
directly visible it threw the moving shadows of
the Vickers-Vimy on to the clouds below.</p>

<p>Mostly I could see the moon by looking over
the machine's starboard planes. I tried to
sight on it for latitude, but the horizon was still
too indefinite.</p>

<p>An aura of unreality seemed to surround
us as we flew onward towards the dawn and
Ireland. The fantastic surroundings impinged
on my alert consciousness as something extravagantly
abnormal&mdash;the distorted ball of a moon,
the weird half-light, the monstrous cloud-shapes,
the fog below and around us, the misty
indefiniteness of space, the changeless drone,
drone, drone of the motors.</p>

<p>To take my mind from the strangeness of it
all, I turned to the small food-cupboard at the
back of the cockpit. Twice during the night
we drank and ate in snatches, Alcock keeping
a hand on the joystick while using his other to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>take the sandwiches, chocolate and thermos
flask, which I passed to him one at a time.</p>

<p>Outside the cockpit was bitter cold, but inside
was well-sheltered warmth, due to the protective
windscreen, the nearness of the radiator,
and our thick clothing. Almost our only physical
discomfort resulted from the impossibility
of any but cramped movements. It was a relief
even to turn from one motor to the other, when
examining them by the light of my electric
torch.</p>

<p>After several hours in the confined quarters,
I wanted to kick out, to walk, to stretch myself.
For Alcock, who never removed his feet from
the rudder-bars, the feeling of restiveness must
have been painfully uncomfortable.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary that during the sixteen
hours of the flight neither Alcock nor I felt the
least desire for sleep. During the war, pilots
and observers of night-bombing craft, their job
completed, often suffered intensely on the homeward
journey, from the effort of will necessary
to fight the drowsiness induced by relaxed tension
and the monotonous, never-varying hum
of the motor&mdash;and this after only four to six
hours of continuous flying.</p>

<p>Probably, however, such tiredness was mostly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>reaction and mental slackening after the object
of their journeys&mdash;the bombing of a target&mdash;had
been achieved. Our own object would not
be achieved until we saw Ireland beneath us;
and it could not be achieved unless we kept our
every faculty concentrated on it all the time.
There was therefore no mental reaction during
our long period of wakeful flying over the
ocean.</p>

<p>We began to think about sunrise and the
new day. We had been flying for over ten
hours; and the next ten would bring success or
failure. We had more than enough petrol
to complete the long journey, for Alcock had
treated the engines very gently, never running
them all out, but varying the power from half to
three-quarter throttle. Our course seemed
satisfactory, and the idea of failure was concerned
only with the chance of engine mishap,
such as had befallen Hawker and Grieve, or of
something entirely unforeseen.</p>

<p>Something entirely unforeseen did happen.
At about sunrise&mdash;3:10 A. M. to be exact&mdash;when
we were between thirty-five hundred and four
thousand feet, we ran into a thick bank that projected
above the lower layer of cloud. All
around was dense, drifting vapor, which cut off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>from our range of vision even the machine's
wing tips and the fore end of the fuselages.</p>

<p>This was entirely unexpected; and, separated
suddenly from external guidance, we lost our instinct
of balance. The machine, left to its own
devices, swung, flew amok, and began to perform
circus tricks.</p>

<p>Until we should see either the horizon or the
sky or the sea, and thus restore our sense of
the horizontal, we could tell only by the instruments
what was happening to the Vickers-Vimy.
Unless there be outside guidance, the effect on
the Augean canal in one's ears of the centrifugal
force developed by a turn in a cloud causes
a complete loss of dimensional equilibrium, so
that one is inclined to think that an aëroplane
is level even when it is at a big angle with the
horizontal. The horizontal, in fact, seems to
be inside the machine.</p>

<p>A glance at the instruments on the dashboard
facing us made it obvious that we were not
flying level. The air speed crept up to ninety
knots, while Alcock was trying to restore equilibrium.
He pulled back the control lever; but
apparently the air speed meter was jammed,
for although the Vickers-Vimy must have nosed
upwards, the reading remained at ninety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>And then we stalled&mdash;that is to say our speed
dropped below the minimum necessary for
heavier-than-air flight. The machine hung motionless
for a second, after which it heeled over
and fell into what was either a spinning nosedive,
or a very steep spiral.</p>

<p>The compass needle continued to revolve
rapidly, showing that the machine was swinging
as it dropped; but, still hemmed in as we were
by the thick vapor, we could not tell how, or
in which direction we were spinning.</p>

<p>Before the pilot could reduce the throttle,
the roar of the motors had almost doubled in
volume, and instead of the usual 1650 to 1700
revolutions per minute, they were running at
about 2200 revolutions per minute. Alcock
shut off the throttles, and the vibration ceased.</p>

<p>Apart from the changing levels marked by the
aneroid, only the fact that our bodies were
pressed tightly against the seats indicated that
the machine was falling. How and at what
angle it was falling, we knew not. Alcock tried
to centralize the controls, but failed because we
had lost all sense of what was central. I
searched in every direction for an external sign,
and saw nothing but opaque nebulousness.</p>

<p>The aneroid, meantime, continued to register
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>a height that dropped ever lower and alarmingly
lower&mdash;three thousand, two thousand, one
thousand, five hundred feet. I realized the possibility
that we might hit the ocean at any
moment, if the aneroid's exactitude had been
affected by differences between the barometric
conditions of our present position and those of
St. John's, where the instrument was set.</p>

<p>A more likely danger was that our cloud
might stretch down to the surface of the ocean;
in which case Alcock, having obtained no sight
of the horizon, would be unable to counteract
the spin in time.</p>

<p>I made ready for the worst, loosening my
safety belt and preparing to salve my notes of
the flight. All precautions would probably have
been unavailing, however, for had we fallen into
the sea, there would have been small hope of
survival. We were on a steep slant, and even
had we escaped drowning when first submerged,
the dice would be heavily loaded against the
chance of rescue by a passing ship.</p>

<p>And then while these thoughts were chasing
each other across my mind, we left the cloud as
suddenly as we had entered it. We were now
less than a hundred feet from the ocean. The
sea-surface did not appear below the machine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>but, owing to the wide angle at which we were
tilted against the horizontal, seemed to stand up
level, sideways to us.</p>

<p>Alcock looked at the ocean and the horizon,
and almost instantaneously regained his mental
equilibrium in relation to external balance.
Fortunately the Vickers-Vimy maneuvers
quickly, and it responded rapidly to Alcock's
action in centralizing the control lever and rudder
bar. He opened up the throttles. The
motors came back to life, and the danger was
past. Once again disaster had been averted
by the pilot's level-headedness and skill.</p>

<p>When at last the machine swung back to
the level and flew parallel with the Atlantic,
our height was fifty feet. It appeared as if we
could stretch downward and almost touch the
great white-caps that crested the surface. With
the motors shut off we could actually <i>hear</i> the
voice of the cheated ocean as its waves swelled,
broke, and swelled again.</p>

<p>The compass needle, which had continued to
swing, now stabilized itself and quivered toward
the west, showing that the end of the spin left
us facing America. As we did not want to
return to St. John's, and earnestly wanted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>reach Ireland, Alcock turned the machine in a
wide semi-circle and headed eastward, while
climbing away from the ocean and towards the
lowest clouds.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br /><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>Morning</small></span><br /><br /></h2>


<p>Sunrise made itself known to us merely as
a gradual lightening that showed nothing
but clouds, above and below. The sun itself
was nowhere visible.</p>

<p>We seemed to be flying in and out of dense
patches of cloud; for every now and then we
would pass through a white mountain, emerge
into a small area of clear atmosphere, and then
be confronted with another enormous barrier
of nebulousness.</p>

<p>The indefiniteness of dawn disappointed my
hopes of taking observations. Already at three
o'clock I had scribbled a note to the pilot:
"<i>Immediately you see sun rising, point machine
straight towards it, and we'll get compass bearings.</i>"
I had already worked out a table of
hours, angles and azimuths of the sun at its
rising, to serve as a check upon our position;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>but, as things happened, I was obliged to resume
navigation by means of "dead reckoning."</p>

<p>A remark written in my log at twenty minutes
past four was that the Vickers-Vimy had
climbed to six thousand five hundred feet, and
was above the lower range of clouds. For the
rest, the three hours that followed sunrise I
remember chiefly as a period of envelopment by
clouds, and ever more clouds. Soon, as we
continued to climb, the machine was traveling
through a mist of uniform thickness that completely
shut off from our range of vision everything
outside a radius of a few yards from
the wing-tips.</p>

<p>And then came a spell of bad weather, beginning
with heavy rain, and continuing with snow.
The downpour seemed to meet us almost horizontally,
owing to the high speed of the machine,
as compared with the rate of only a few
feet per second at which the rain and snow
fell.</p>

<p>The snow gave place to hail, mingled with
sleet. The sheltered position of the cockpit,
and the stream-lining of the machine, kept us
free from the downfall so long as we remained
seated; but if we exposed a hand or a face above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>the windscreen's protection, it would meet
scores of tingling stabs from the hailstones.</p>

<p>When we had reached a height of eight thousand
eight hundred feet, I discovered that the
glass face of the gasoline overflow gauge,
which showed whether or not the supply of fuel
for the motors was correct, had become obscured
by clotted snow. To guard against carburetor
trouble, it was essential that the pilot
should be able to read the gauge at any moment.
It was up to me, therefore, to clear away
the snow from the glass.</p>

<p>The gauge was fixed on one of the center section
struts. The only way to reach it was by
climbing out of the cockpit and kneeling on
top of the fuselage, while holding on to a strut
for balance. This I did; and the unpleasant
change from the comparative warmth of the
cockpit to the biting, icy cold outside was very
unpleasant. The violent rush of displaced air,
which tended to sweep me backward, was another
discomfort.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty, however, in reaching upward
and rubbing the snow from the face of the
gauge. Until the storm ended, a repetition of
this performance at fairly frequent intervals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>continued to be necessary. There was, however,
scarcely any danger in kneeling on the
fuselage as long as Alcock kept the machine
level.</p>

<p>Every now and then we examined the motors;
for on them depended whether the next four
hours would bring success or failure. Meantime,
we were still living for the moment; and
although I was intensely glad that four-fifths
of the ocean had been crossed, I could afford
to spare no time for speculation on what a safe
arrival would mean to us. As yet, neither of
us was aware of the least sign of weariness,
mental or physical.</p>

<p>When I had nothing more urgent on hand,
I listened at the wireless receiver but I heard no
message for us from beginning to end of the
flight. Any kind of communication with ship
or shore would have been welcome, as a reminder
that we were not altogether out of touch
with the world below. The complete absence
of such contact made it seem that nobody cared
a darn about us.</p>

<p>The entry that I scribbled in my log at 6:20
A. M. was that we had reached a height of nine
thousand four hundred feet, and were still in
drifting cloud, which was sometimes so thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>that it cut off from view parts of the Vickers-Vimy.
Snow was still falling, and the top sides
of the plane were covered completely by a
crusting of frozen sleet.</p>

<p>The sleet imbedded itself in the hinges of the
ailerons and jammed them, so that for about
an hour the machine had scarcely any lateral
control. Fortunately the Vickers-Vimy has
plenty of inherent lateral stability; and, as the
rudder controls were never clogged by sleet,
we were able to carry on with caution.</p>

<p>Alcock continued to climb steadily, so as to
get above the seemingly interminable clouds and
let me have a clear sky for purposes of navigation.
At five o'clock, when we were in the
levels round about eleven thousand feet, I
caught the sun for a moment&mdash;just a pin-point
glimmer through a cloud-gap. There was no
horizon; but I was able to obtain a reading with
the help of my Abney spirit level.</p>

<p>This observation gave us a position close to
the Irish coast. Yet I could not be sure of just
where we were on the line indicated by it. We
therefore remained at eleven thousand feet
until, at 7:20 A. M., I had definitely fixed the
position line. This accomplished, I scribbled
the following message and handed it across to
the pilot:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>"<i>We had better go lower down, where the
air is warmer, and where we might pick up a
steamer.</i>"</p>

<p>Just as we had started to nose downward,
the starboard motor began to pop ominously, as
if it were backfiring through one of its carburetors.
Alcock throttled back while keeping the
machine on a slow glide. The popping thereupon
ceased.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock we had descended from
eleven thousand to one thousand feet, where the
machine was still surrounded by cloudy vapor.
Here, however, the atmosphere was much warmer,
and the ailerons were again operating.</p>

<p>Alcock was feeling his way down gently and
alertly, not knowing whether the cloud extended
to the ocean, nor at what moment the machine's
undercarriage might touch the waves. He had
loosened his safety belt, and was ready to
abandon ship if we hit the water. I myself felt
uncomfortable about the danger of sudden immersion,
for it was very possible that a change
in barometric conditions could have made the
aneroid show a false reading.</p>

<p class="center"><small>ALL ABOARD FOR THE FIRST TRIAL FLIGHT</small></p></div>
</div>



<p>But once again we were lucky. At a height
of five hundred feet the Vickers-Vimy emerged
from the pall of cloud, and we saw the ocean&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>restless surface of dull gray. Alcock at once
opened up the throttles, and both motors responded.
Evidently a short rest had been all
that the starboard motor needed when it began
to pop, for it now gave no further signs of
trouble.</p>

<p>I reached for the Drift Bearing Plate, and
after observation on the ocean, found that we
were moving on a course seventy-five degrees
true, at one hundred and ten knots ground speed
with a wind of thirty knots from the direction
of two hundred and fifteen degrees true. I had
been reckoning on a course of seventy-seven
degrees true, with calculations based on our
midnight position; so that evidently we were
north of the prescribed track. Still, we were
not so far north as to miss Ireland, which fact
was all that mattered to any extent.</p>

<p>In my correction of the compass bearing, I
could only guess at the time when the wind
had veered from its earlier direction. I made
the assumption that the northerly drift had
existed ever since my sighting on the Pole Star
and Vega during the night, and I reckoned that
our position at eight o'clock would consequently
be about fifty-four degrees N. latitude, ten degrees
thirty min. W. longitude. Taking these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>figures, and with the help of the navigation machine,
which rested on my knees, I calculated
that our course to Galway was about one hundred
and twenty-five degrees true. Allowing
for variation and wind I therefore set a compass
course of one hundred and seventy degrees,
and indicated to the pilot the necessary
change in direction by means of the following
note and diagram:</p>


<p>"<i>Make course</i></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/072.jpg">
<img src="images/072_th.jpg" alt="Diagram" /></a>
</div>

<p>"<i>Don't be afraid of going S. We have had
too much N. already.</i>"<br /><br /></p>


<p>Alcock nodded and ruddered the Vickers-Vimy
around gently, until its compass showed
a reading of 170 degrees.</p>

<p>My calculations, if correct, proved that we
were quite close to Ireland and journey's end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>As we flew eastward, just below the lowest
clouds and from two hundred to three hundred
feet above the sea, we strained our eyes for a
break in the monotonous vista of gray waves;
but we could find not even a ship.</p>

<p>Although neither of us felt hungry, we decided
to breakfast at eight o'clock, partly to kill
time and partly to take our minds from the
rising excitement induced by the hope that we
might sight land at any instant. I placed a
sandwich, followed by some chocolate, in
Alcock's left hand. His right hand remained
always on the control lever and his feet on the
rudder bar.</p>

<p>At no time during the past sixteen hours had
the pilot's hands and feet left the controls.
This was a difficult achievement for such a long
period, especially as a rubber device, fitted to
ease the strain, proved to be valueless. Elastic,
linked to a turnbuckle, had been attached to the
control lever and rudder bar; but in the hurry
that preceded our departure from St. John's,
the elastic was cut too short. All the weight
of the controls, therefore, bore directly on the
pilot.</p>

<p>The machine now tended to sag downward,
being nose-heavy because its incidence had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>changed, owing to the gradual alteration in the
center of gravity as the rear gasoline tanks
emptied. Alcock was thus obliged to exert continuous
backward pressure on the control lever.</p>

<p>I had screwed on the lids of the thermos flask,
and was placing the remains of the food in the
tiny cupboard behind my seat, when Alcock
grabbed my shoulder, twisted me round, beamed
excitedly, and pointed ahead and below. His
lips were moving, but whatever he said was inaudible
above the roar of the motors.</p>

<p>I followed the direction indicated by his outstretched
fore-finger; and, barely visible
through the mist, it showed me two tiny specks
of&mdash;<i>land</i>. This happened at 8:15 A. M. on
June 15th.</p>

<p>With a light heart, I put away charts and
tables of calculation, and disregarded the compass
needle. My work as navigator of the
flight was at an end.</p>

<hr class="r65" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br /><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Arrival</small></span><br /><br /></h2>


<p>Alcock flew straight for the specks of
land, which revealed themselves as two
tiny islands&mdash;Ecshal and Turbot, as we afterwards
discovered. In his log of the return
flight, from New York to Norfolk, of the British
airship <i>R-34</i>, Brigadier-General Maitland, C.
M. G., D. S. O., notes the curious coincidence
that his first sight of land was when these same
two islands appeared on the starboard bow of
the dirigible.</p>

<p>From above the islands the mainland was
visible, and we steered for the nearest point
on it. The machine was still just underneath
the clouds, and flying at two hundred and fifty
feet; from which low height I saw plainly the
white breakers foaming on to the shore. We
crossed the coast of Ireland at 8:25 A. M.</p>

<p>I was then uncertain of our exact location,
and suggested to Alcock that the best plan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>would be to find a railway line and follow it
south. A few minutes later, however, the wireless
masts at Clifden gave the key to our position.
To attract attention, I fired two red
flares from the Very pistol; but as they seemed
to be unnoticed from the ground, we circled
over the village of Clifden, about two miles
from the wireless station.</p>

<p>Although slightly off our course when we
reached the coast, we were in the direct line of
flight for Galway, at which place I had calculated
to hit Ireland. Not far ahead we could
see a cluster of hills, with their tops lost in low-lying
clouds.</p>

<p>Here and elsewhere the danger of running
into high ground hidden from sight by the mist
would have been great, had we continued to fly
across Ireland. Alcock, therefore, decided to
land.</p>

<p>If the atmosphere had been clearer, we could
easily have reached London before touching
earth, for the tanks of the Vickers-Vimy still
contained enough gasoline to keep the machine
in the air for ten hours longer. Thus, had we
lost our way over the ocean, there would have
been a useful margin of time for cruising about
in search of ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>Having made up our minds to land at once,
we searched below for a smooth stretch of
ground. The most likely looking place in the
neighborhood of Clifden was a field near the
wireless station. With engines shut off, we
glided towards it, heading into the wind.</p>

<p>Alcock flattened out at exactly the right moment.
The machine sank gently, the wheels
touched earth and began to run smoothly over
the surface. Already I was indulging in the
comforting reflection that the anxious flight had
ended with a perfect landing. Then, so softly
as not to be noticed at first, the front of the
Vickers-Vimy tilted inexplicably, while the tail
rose. Suddenly the craft stopped with an unpleasant
squelch, tipped forward, shook itself,
and remained poised on a slant, with its fore-end
buried in the ground, as if trying to stand
on its head.</p>

<p>I reached out a hand and arm just in time to
save a nasty bump when the shock threw me
forward. As it was, I only stopped a jarring
collision with the help of my nose. Alcock had
braced himself against the rudder control bar.
The pressure he exerted against it to save himself
from falling actually bent the straight bar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>which was of hollow steel, almost into the shape
of a horse-shoe.</p>

<p>Deceived by its smooth appearance, we had
landed on top of a bog; which misfortune made
the first non-stop transatlantic flight finish in
a crash. It was pitiful to see the distorted
shape of the aëroplane that had brought us from
America, as it sprawled in ungainly manner
over the sucking surface. The machine's nose
and its lower wings were deep in the bog. The
empty cockpit in front, used in a Vickers-Vimy
bomber by the observer, was badly bent; but,
being of steel, it did not collapse. Quite possibly
we owe our lives to this fact. In passing,
and while gripping firmly my wooden penholder
(for the year is not yet over), I consider
it extraordinary that no lives have been lost in
the transatlantic flights of 1919.</p>

<p>The leading edge of the lower plane was bent
in some places and smashed in others, the gasoline
connections had snapped, and four of the
propeller blades were buried in the ground, although
none were broken. That about completed
the record of preliminary damage.</p>

<p>We had landed at 8:40 A. M., after being in
the air for sixteen hours and twenty-eight minutes.
The flight from coast to coast, on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>straight course of one thousand six hundred
and eighty nautical miles, lasted only fifteen
hours and fifty-seven minutes, our average
speed being one hundred and five to one hundred
and six knots. For this relatively rapid
performance, a strong following wind was
largely responsible.</p>

<p>As a result of the burst connections from
tank to carburetor, gasoline began to swill into
the rear cockpit while we were still inside it.
Very fortunately the liquid did not ignite.
Alcock had taken care to switch off the current
on the magnetos, as soon as he realized that a
crash was imminent, so that the sparks should
have no chance of starting a fire.</p>

<p>We scrambled out as best we could, and lost
no time in salving the mailbag and our instruments.
The gasoline rose rapidly, and it was
impossible to withdraw my chart and the Baker
navigating machine before they had been damaged.</p>

<p>I then fired two white Very flares, as a signal
for help. Almost immediately a small party,
composed of officers and men belonging to the
military detachment at Clifden, approached
from the wireless station.</p>

<p>"Anybody hurt?"&mdash;the usual inquiry when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>an aëroplane is crashed&mdash;was the first remark
when they arrived within shouting distance.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where you from?"&mdash;this when they had
helped us to clear the cockpit.</p>

<p>"America."</p>

<p>Somebody laughed politely, as if in answer
to an attempt at facetiousness that did not
amount to much, but that ought to be taken
notice of, anyhow, for the sake of courtesy.
Quite evidently nobody received the statement
seriously at first. Even a mention of our names
meant nothing to them, and they remained unconvinced
until Alcock showed them the mail-bag
from St. John's. Then they relieved their
surprised feelings by spontaneous cheers and
painful hand-shakes, and led us to the officers'
mess for congratulations and hospitality.</p>

<p>Burdened as we were with flying kit and
heavy boots, the walk over the bog was a dragging
discomfort. In addition, I suddenly discovered
an intense sleepiness, and could easily
have let myself lose consciousness while standing
upright.</p>

<p>Arrived at the station, our first act was to
send telegrams to the firm of Messrs. Vickers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>Ltd., which built the Vickers-Vimy, to the London
<i>Daily Mail</i>, which promoted the transatlantic
competition, and to the Royal Aëro Club,
which controlled it.</p>

<p>My memories of that day are dim and incomplete.
I felt a keen sense of relief at being
on land again; but this was coupled with a certain
amount of dragging reaction from the tense
mental concentration during the flight, so that
my mind sagged. I was very sleepy, but not
physically tired.</p>

<p>We lurched as we walked, owing to the stiffness
that resulted from our having sat in the
tiny cockpit for seventeen hours. Alcock, who
during the whole period had kept his feet on
the rudder bar and one hand on the control
lever, would not confess to anything worse than
a desire to stand up for the rest of his life&mdash;or
at least until he could sit down painlessly. My
hands were very unsteady. My mind was quite
clear on matters pertaining to the flight, but
hazy on extraneous subjects. After having
listened so long to the loud-voiced hum of the
Rolls-Royce motors, made louder than ever
by the broken exhaust pipe on the starboard
side, we were both very deaf, and our ears
would not stop ringing.</p>

<p>Later in the day we motored to Galway with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>a representative of the London <i>Daily Mail</i>. It
was a strange but very welcome change to see
solid objects flashing past us, instead of miles
upon monotonous miles of drifting, cloudy
vapor.</p>

<p>Several times during that drive I lost the
thread of connection with tangible surroundings,
and lived again in near retrospect the
fantastic happenings of the day, night and
morning that had just passed. Subconsciously
I still missed the rhythmic, relentless drone of
the Rolls-Royce aëro-engines. My eyes had not
yet become accustomed to the absence of clouds
around and below, and my mind felt somehow
lost, now that it was no longer preoccupied with
heavenly bodies, horizon, time, direction, charts,
drift, tables of calculations, sextant, spirit level,
compass, aneroid, altimeter, wireless receiver
and the unexpected.</p>

<p>For a while, in fact, the immediate past
seemed more prominent than the immediate
present. Lassitude of mind, coupled with reaction
from the long strain of tense and unbroken
concentration on one supreme objective,
made me lose my grip of normal continuity, so
that I answered questions mechanically and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>wanted to avoid the effort of talk. The outstanding
events and impressions of the flight&mdash;for
example the long spin from four thousand
to fifty feet, and the sudden sight of the white-capped
ocean at the end of it&mdash;passed and repassed
across my consciousness. I do not
know whether Alcock underwent the same mental
processes, but he remained very silent.
Above all I felt the need of reëstablishing normal
balance by means of sleep.</p>

<p>The wayside gatherings seemed especially unreal&mdash;almost
as if they had been scenes on the
film. By some extraordinary method of news
transmission the report of our arrival had
spread all over the district, and in many districts
between Clifden and Galway curious
crowds had gathered. Near Galway we were
stopped by another automobile, in which was
Major Mays of the Royal Aëro Club, whose
duty it was to examine the seals on the Vickers-Vimy,
thus making sure that we had not landed
in Ireland in a machine other than that in
which we left Newfoundland. A reception had
been prepared at Galway; but our hosts, realizing
how tired we must be, considerately made it
a short and informal affair. Afterwards we
slept&mdash;for the first time in over forty hours.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>Aftermath of Arrival</small></span><br /><br /></h2>


<p>Alcock and I awoke to find ourselves in
a wonderland of seeming unreality&mdash;the
product of violent change from utter isolation
during the long flight to unexpected contact with
crowds of people interested in us.</p>

<p>To begin with, getting up in the morning,
after a satisfactory sleep of nine hours, was
strange. In our eastward flight of two thousand
miles we had overtaken time, in less than
the period between one sunset and another, to
the extent of three and a half hours. Our physical
systems having accustomed themselves to
habits regulated by the clocks of Newfoundland,
we were reluctant to rise at 7 A. M.; for subconsciousness
suggested that it was but 3:30
A. M.</p>

<p>This difficulty of adjustment to the sudden
change in time lasted for several days. Probably
it will be experienced by all passengers
traveling on the rapid trans-ocean air services
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>of the future&mdash;those who complete a westward
journey becoming early risers without effort,
those who land after an eastward flight becoming
unconsciously lazy in the mornings, until
the jolting effect of the dislocation wears off,
and habit has accustomed itself to the new conditions.</p>

<p>Then, after breakfast&mdash;eaten in an atmosphere
of the deepest content&mdash;there began a
succession of congratulatory ovations. For
these we were totally unprepared; and with our
relaxed minds, we could not easily adapt ourselves
to the conditions attendant upon being
magnets of the world's attentive curiosity.</p>

<p>First came a reception from the town of
Galway, involving many addresses and the presentation
of a memento in the form of a Claddagh
ring, which had historical connections with
a landing on the coast of Ireland thereabouts
by vessels of the Spanish Armada.</p>

<p>The warm-hearted crowd that we found waiting
at Galway Station both amazed and daunted
us. We were grateful for their loud appreciation,
but scarcely able to respond to it adequately.
Flowers were offered, and we met the
vanguard of the autograph hunters. We must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>have signed our names hundreds of times during
the journey to Dublin&mdash;on books, cards, old
envelopes and scraps of paper of every shape
and every state of cleanliness. This we did
wonderingly, not yet understanding why so
many people should ask for our signatures,
when three days earlier few people had heard
of our names.</p>

<p>The men, women and children that thronged
every station on the way to Dublin seemed to
place a far higher value on our success than we
did ourselves. Until now, perhaps, we had
been too self-centered to realize that other people
might be particularly interested in a flight
from America to England. We had finished the
job we wanted to do, and could not comprehend
why it should lead to fuss.</p>

<p>Now, however, I know that the crowds saw
more clearly than I did, and that their cheers
were not for us personally, but for what they
regarded as a manifestation of the spirit of adventure,
the True Romance&mdash;call it what you
will. For the moment this elusive ideal was
suggested to them by the first non-stop journey
by air across the Atlantic, which we had been
fortunate enough to make.</p>

<p>At one station, where a military band played
our train in and out again, a wooden model of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>an aëroplane was presented to Alcock by a
schoolboy. At Dublin, reached on the morning
of Trinity Sunday, Alcock and I passed with
difficulty through the welcoming crowds, and
drove towards the Automobile Club in separate
cars. In due course, I reached sanctuary; but
where was Alcock? We waited and waited, and
finally sent out scouts to search for him. They
came back with the news that he had been kidnapped,
and taken to Commons in Trinity College.</p>

<p>Landing at Holyhead next morning, we were
welcomed back to the shores of England by Mr.
R. K. Pierson, designer of our Vickers-Vimy
machine, by Captain Vickers, of the famous firm
that built it, and by Mr. C. Johnson, of the
Rolls-Royce Company that supplied our motors.
Scenes all along the line to London were
a magnified repetition of those from Galway to
Dublin. Chester, Crewe, Rugby and other towns
each sent its Mayor or another representative
to the station. Aëroplanes escorted the train
all the way to London. Again we could only
play our part in a more or less dazed state of
grateful wonder.</p>

<p>Of the warm-hearted welcome of the people
of London, I have confused recollections
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>that include more receptions, more and larger
crowds, more stormy greetings, and an exciting,
pleasant drive to the Royal Aëro Club. Alcock
delivered to the postal authorities the
mail-bag from St. John's, with regrets that it
had not been possible to fly direct to London
with the letters. In the evening we separated,
Alcock to see a big prize fight, I to visit my
fiancée.</p>

<p>Perhaps the welcome that we appreciated
most was that given us next day when, at the
Weybridge works of the Vickers Company, we
were cheered and cheered by the men and girls
who had built our transatlantic craft. We were
glad indeed to be able to tell them and the designer
of the machine that their handiwork had
stood a difficult test magnificently, as had the
Rolls-Royce engines. One of my most sincere
reasons for satisfaction was that the late Mr.
Albert Vickers, one of the founders of the great
firm, regarded the flights as having maintained
the Vickers tradition of efficiency, originality
and good workmanship.</p>

<p>That Lieutenant-Commander Read, U.S.N.,
who commanded the American flying boat
<i>N. C. 4</i> in its flight from America to England,
had left London before our arrival was a cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>of real regret. Both Alcock and I were anxious
to meet him and his crew, so that we might
compare our respective experiences of aërial
navigation and of weather conditions over the
Atlantic. The United States aviators who flew
to Europe, and those that were so unlucky in
coming to grief at the Azores, showed themselves
to be real sportsmen; and without any
exception, there was the best possible feeling between
them and all the British aviators who
made, or attempted to make, a non-stop journey
from Newfoundland to Ireland.</p>

<p>Although I am supremely glad to have had
the opportunity of flying the Atlantic by aëroplane,
afterthoughts on the risks and chances
taken have convinced me that, while our own
effort may have been useful as a pioneer demonstration,
single or twin engine aircraft are
altogether unsuitable for trans-ocean voyages.
We were successful&mdash;yes. But a temporary
failure of either of our motors (although this
is unlikely when dealing with Rolls-Royce or
other first-class aëro motors) would have meant
certain disaster and likely death.</p>

<p>Another vital drawback of the smaller machines
is that so much space, and so much disposable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>lift, is needed for fuel that the number
of persons on board must be limited to two,
or in some cases three, and no freight can be
taken. Yet another is that should the navigator
of an aëroplane make an important error in
calculation while flying over the ocean in fog or
mist, an enforced descent into the water, after
the limited quantity of fuel has been expended
over a wrong course, is more than possible.</p>

<p>In the present condition of practical aëronautics,
the only heavier-than-air craft likely to
be suitable for flying the Atlantic are the large
flying boats now being built by various aircraft
companies; and even they are limited as to size
by certain definite formulæ. The development
in the near future of long flights over the ocean
would seem, therefore, to be confined to lighter-than-air
craft.</p>

<p>In this connection the two voyages across the
Atlantic of the British government airship R-34,
not long after Alcock and I had returned to
London, was a big step towards the age of regular
air service between Britain and America.
With five motors the <i>R-34</i> could carry on if one,
or even two of them were out of action. In
fact, on its return flight, one motor broke down
beyond the possibility of immediate repair; although
there were ample facilities and an ample
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>crew for effecting immediate repairs in the air.
Yet she completed her journey without difficulty.
With a disposable lift of twenty-nine
tons, the airship carried plenty of fuel for all
contingencies, an adequate crew, and heavy
wireless apparatus that could not have been
fitted on the larger aëroplanes.</p>

<p>Despite all this preliminary weight, a large
collection of parcels, letters and newspapers
were taken from America to England in record
time. Had the weather conditions been at
all suitable she could easily have brought the
mail direct from New York to London by air.
All honor to General Maitland, Major Scott and
the other men who carried out this astonishing
demonstration so early as July, 1919.</p>

<p>Even vessels of the <i>R-34</i> type, however, are
quite unsuitable for regular traffic across the
Atlantic. Much bigger craft will be needed if
the available space and the disposable lift are
to be sufficient for the carrying of freight or
passengers on a commercial basis. Already
the construction of airships two and a half and
five times the size of the <i>R-34</i>, with approximate
disposable lifts of one hundred and two
hundred tons respectively, is projected. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>such craft are accomplished facts, and when
further progress has been made in solving
weather and navigation problems, we may look
for transatlantic flights on a commercial basis.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br /><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Navigation of Aircraft</small></span><br /><br /></h2>



<p>I do not claim to be an especial authority on
the theory of navigation&mdash;indeed, it was as
a prisoner of war that I first took up seriously
the study of that science. But I believe that
sustained and sufficient concentration can give
a man what he wants; and on this assumption
I decided to learn whatever might be learned
about navigation as applied to aircraft. As yet,
like most aspects of aëronautics, this is rather
indefinite, although research and specially
adapted instruments will probably make it as
exact as marine navigation.</p>

<p>Navigation is the means whereby the mariner
or aviator ascertains his position on the
surface of the earth, and determines the exact
direction in which he must head his craft in
order to reach its destination.</p>

<p>The methods of navigation employed by mariners
are the result of centuries of research and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>invention, but have not yet reached finality&mdash;witness
the introduction within the last few
years of the Gyroscopic Compass and the Directional
Wireless Telegraph Apparatus, as
well as of improved methods of calculation.</p>

<p>In short journeys over land by aëroplane or
airship the duties of a navigator are light, so
long as he can see the ground and check his
progress towards the objective by observation
and a suitable map.</p>

<p>But for long distance flights, especially over
the ocean and under circumstances whereby the
ground cannot be seen, the navigator of the air
borrows much from the navigator of the sea.
He makes modifications and additions, necessitated
by the different conditions of keeping to
a set course through the atmosphere and of
keeping to a set course through the ocean but
the principles underlying the two forms of
navigation are identical.</p>

<p>It is impossible to explain aërial navigation
without seeming to paraphrase other writers on
the subject. One of the simplest explanations
of the science is that of Lieutenant Commander
K. Mackenzie Grieve in "Our Atlantic Attempt,"
which he wrote in collaboration with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>Mr. Harry Hawker, his pilot, after their glorious
attempt to win the London <i>Daily Mail's</i>
transatlantic competition.</p>

<p>The chief differences between the navigation
of aircraft and the navigation of seacraft are
occasioned by:</p>

<p>(a) The vastly greater speed of aircraft, necessitating
more frequent observations and
quicker methods of calculation.</p>

<p>(b) The serious drift caused by the wind.
This may take aircraft anything up to forty or
more miles off the course in each hour's flying,
according to the direction and strength of the
wind. In cloudy weather, or at night, a change
in the wind can alter the drift without the
knowledge of the navigator. Hence, special
precautions must be taken to observe the drift
at all possible times.</p>

<p>(c) The absence of need for extreme accuracy
of navigation in the air, since a ten or
even twenty mile error from the destination in
a long journey is permissible. Another favorable
point is that rocks, reefs and shoals need
not be avoided. This permits the aërial navigator
to use short cuts and approximations in
calculation, which would be criminal in marine
navigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three methods of aërial navigation&mdash;"Dead
Reckoning," Astronomical Observation,
and Directional Wireless Telegraphy.
None should be used alone; for although accuracy
may be obtained with any single method,
it is highly advisable to check each by means
of the others.</p>

<p>As in the case of marine navigation, a reliable
compass, either of the magnetic or gyroscopic
type, is essential for aërial navigation,
as well as an accurate and reliable chronometer.
Suitable charts must be provided, showing all
parts of the route to be covered. When the
magnetic compass is used, such charts should
show the variation between True and Magnetic
North at different points on the route.</p>


<h3>NAVIGATION BY "DEAD RECKONING"</h3>

<p>"Dead Reckoning" is the simplest method of
navigation; and, under favorable conditions, it
gives a high degree of accuracy. A minimum
of observation is required, but careful calculation
is essential.</p>

<p>The "Dead Reckoning" position of an aëroplane
or airship at any time is calculated from
its known speed and direction over the surface
of the earth or ocean, and its known course as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>indicated by the magnetic or gyroscopic compass.</p>

<p>To determine the direction of movement of
an aëroplane or airship, as apart from the direction
in which it is headed, an instrument
known as a Drift Indicator, or Drift Bearing
Plate, is used.</p>

<p>One form of Drift Indicator consists of a
simple dial, with the center cut away and a wire
stretched diametrically across it. The outer
edge of the dial is divided into degrees, in a
similar manner to that of the compass. It is
mounted in such a way that an observer can,
by looking through the center of the disc, see
the ground or ocean below him. The disc is
then turned until objects on the ground&mdash;or
white-caps, icebergs, ships, or other objects visible
on the surface of the ocean&mdash;are seen to
move parallel with the wire, without in any way
deviating from it. The angle which the wire
then makes with the direction in which the nose
of the aëroplane or airship is pointing gives
the angle of drift.</p>

<p>The ground speed (or speed over the surface
of the earth) of aircraft can be measured by observing
the time taken in passing over any fixed
or very slowly moving object, while a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>angular distance is described&mdash;this being found
by suitable sights, attached to the Drift Bearing
Plate. From the result, considered in conjunction
with the height of the aëroplane or
airship, the actual speed over the surface is
calculated. This speed will be in the direction
shown by the wire of the Drift Bearing Plate.</p>

<p>The ground speed so found will differ nearly
always from the air speed, as shown by the air
speed meter, because of the effect of the wind.
The difference is greater or less according to
the wind's relation to the direction in which the
aëroplane or airship is headed.</p>

<p>Having found by observation the drift, the
ground speed and the air speed, a simple instrument
such as the Appleyard Course and
Distance Calculator then permits the aërial
navigator to discover without difficulty, as on
a slide rule, the strength and direction of the
wind. Should the actual track of aircraft over
the earth's surface not coincide with the desired
course, the Course and Distance Calculator,
or a similar instrument, can thus be used
to calculate, in connection with the wind velocity
and direction already found, the direction
in which the nose of the craft must be pointed
in order to correct the deviation due to drift.</p>

point of departure, and noting carefully the time
that elapses between each separate observation
of the ground speed and of the course, the air
navigator, with the aid of a specially prepared
set of "traverse tables" (as used by mariners),
can easily plot on his chart the distance covered
and the direction in which it has been
covered. Hence the position of the aircraft at
any time is either known definitely, or can be
forecast with a fair degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>For aërial navigation by means of "Dead
Reckoning," frequent observations of ground
speed and drift are necessary. If aircraft are
cut off by clouds or fog from all possibility of
sighting the surface of the earth, grave errors
may occur, since in long distance flights the
wind's velocity and direction often change without
the pilot's knowledge.</p>


<h3>NAVIGATION BY ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATION</h3>

<p>In navigation by astronomical observation,
the position of the aëroplane or airship is found
by observing the height above the horizon of
either the sun or another heavenly body, such
as a star that is easy of recognition. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>method depends upon the known fact that at
any given instant the sun is vertically above
some definite point on the earth's surface. This
point can be calculated from the time of the observation
and the declination and equation of
time, as tabulated in the nautical almanac.</p>

<p>In the case of stars, the right ascension of
the sun and of the star also enter into the calculation.
The method of carrying out such calculations
is too involved for the scope of this
volume, and the reader is referred to many of
the excellent text books published on the subject
of navigation.</p>

<p>Since the navigator knows, from the time of
his observation, the point on the earth's surface
over which is the heavenly body in question, it
is clear that around this point circles on the
surface of the earth may be described. From
any point in any one circle the heavenly body
will appear to have the same altitude or elevation
above the horizon. A single observation
of the altitude of any one heavenly body shows,
therefore, only that the observer may be at any
point on such a circle of equal altitude&mdash;otherwise
known as a Sumner circle. But it does not
fix that point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>A second simultaneous observation, of a different
heavenly body, will give a different circle,
corresponding to the position of the second
body. The intersection of these two circles determines
the point of observation.</p>

<p>This fact constitutes a reliable basis for fixing
one's position during a clear night, when
many stars are visible and choice of suitable
heavenly bodies may be made. During the day,
however, the light of the sun prevents other
heavenly bodies from being seen, so that only
a single observation is possible.</p>

<p>If the aëroplane or airship were not moving,
then two successive observations of the sun,
with an interval of an hour or more between
them, would give the intersecting circles and
fix the position. But the aircraft being in motion,
it is necessary to combine the method of
"Dead Reckoning" with the use of the Sumner
circles, as found by observation of the sun's
altitude.</p>

<p>In order to avoid drawing the entire circle,
a small portion only of it is shown on the chart&mdash;so
small that it may be regarded as a straight
line. Such a small section of the Sumner circle
is known as a "position line."</p>

<p>The desired track is laid out on the chart,
and the "Dead Reckoning" position for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>time of the solar observation is indicated on
it. The track should be intersected at this point
by the position line, the observation thus forming
a check upon the "Dead Reckoning."</p>

<p>The altitude of the sun or of a star is measured
by the sextant. For such an observation
to be exact, it is necessary that not only should
the sun or stars be viewed clearly, but that a
clear horizon, formed either by the ocean or by
suitable clouds, should be visible.</p>

<p>Corrections must be applied to the observed
altitude for the aircraft's height above the horizon,
for refraction, and for the diameter of the
body under observation&mdash;the latter two corrections
being given in the nautical almanac.
There may be, also, an error inherent in the
sextant itself. For extremely refined navigation,
corrections are applied in accordance with
the direction and velocity of the aëroplane or
airship; but these are not really necessary, since
navigation of aircraft does not require such
close calculation.</p>

<p>When the sun or star observed is directly
south of the aërial navigator in the northern
hemisphere, or north of him in the southern
hemisphere, the altitude, corrected for declination
of the body under observation, gives the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>aircraft's latitude. When the navigator is directly
east or west, the altitude, corrected for
the time of observation, gives its longitude.</p>

<p>If the horizon is invisible, owing to fogs or
unsuitable clouds, it may be replaced by means
of a spirit level; but great care should be taken
in making such observations, since a spirit level
on an aëroplane or airship is not wholly reliable,
unless the craft is proceeding in an absolutely
straight direction, and without sway of
any kind.</p>

<p>All methods of navigation by Astronomical
Observation fail when the sky is obscured by
clouds and the heavenly bodies cannot be seen.
As a general rule this drawback does not hamper
air navigation to any great extent, since
aircraft should be able to climb above most of
the obscuring clouds. Yet it may happen, as it
did in the case of our transatlantic flight, that
the clouds are too high for such a maneuver.</p>

<p>If it were possible to measure accurately the
true bearing of the sun or star at the moment
of observation, then a single observation of a
single heavenly body would fix the position of
the craft at the intersection of the line of bearing
with the position line. At the time of writing,
however, there are no satisfactory means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>of making such a measurement with the required
degree of accuracy. Apparatus which
will enable this to be done is now in course of
development. Navigation by means of astronomical
observation will thereby be simplified
greatly.</p>


<h3>NAVIGATION BY WIRELESS DIRECTION FINDER</h3>

<p>With the great improvements that have been
made in the year 1919, the guiding of aircraft
by directional wireless telegraphy is rapidly
becoming a reliable and accurate means of
aërial navigation. Although complicated in design
and construction, the complete receiving
equipment for aircraft is now light, compact,
and simple of operation.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/104-1.jpg">
<img src="images/104-1_th.jpg" alt="Coffee on board" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><small>HOT COFFEE WAS TAKEN ABOARD</small></p></div>
</div>


<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/104-2.jpg">
<img src="images/104-2_th.jpg" alt="Start" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><small>SLOW RISING NEARLY CAUSED DISASTER AT THE START OF THE GREAT FLIGHT</small></p></div>
</div>



<p>The receiving equipment on aëroplanes and
airships is arranged so as to indicate, with a
comparatively high degree of accuracy, the direction
from which wireless signals are received.
The position of the sending, or beacon,
station being known, the bearing of the aircraft
from that station may be plotted on a suitable
chart, in which small segments of great circles
are represented by straight lines. Simultaneous
bearings on two known beacon stations are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>sufficient to fix the observer's position with tolerable
accuracy at the intersection of the lines
of bearing, provided that they intersect at a
reasonable angle&mdash;45 degrees or more, where
possible.</p>

<p>With the very close tuning rendered possible
by the use of continuous waves, beacon stations
of the future will probably be provided with
automatic means whereby directional signals
can be sent out at intervals of one hour or less.
Such signals will be coded, so that the crews of
aircraft can identify the wireless station. The
wave lengths must be chosen so as not to interfere
with messages sent from commercial stations.</p>

<p>If there be a beacon station at the air navigator's
destination, it is possible for him to
direct his course so that the craft is always
headed for the beacon; and in due time he will
reach his objective.</p>

<p>This simple but lazy method, however, is not
to be recommended; for, owing to the action
of the wind, the route covered is longer than
the straight course. To counteract drift and
proceed in a direct line towards his destination,
the air navigator frequently has to direct his
course so that the craft is not headed straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>for the objective. Hence, with a single beacon
station, frequent observations of drift are necessary,
if the shortest route is to be followed.
Thus:</p>


<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/106-1.jpg">
<img src="images/106-1_th.jpg" alt="Path: headed towards beacon station" /></a>

<p class="center"><small>Approximate path taken by aircraft headed always towards
beacon station.</small></p>
</div>


<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/106-2.jpg">
<img src="images/106-2_th.jpg" alt="Path: headed to counteract drift" /></a>

<p class="center"><small>Path taken by aircraft headed so as to counteract drift.</small></p>
</div>



<p>When two or more beacon stations are available,
and positions can be ascertained at least
once an hour, observation on the surface of the
ocean for drift, although desirable, is not absolutely
necessary. The drift may be calculated
with accuracy enough from the craft's position
as found by the lines of bearing indicated
in messages from the various beacon stations.</p>

<p>Another method of employing the Wireless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>Direction Finder is for aircraft to send out signals
to two or more beacon stations, which reply
by advising the air navigator of his bearing in
relation to themselves. This is, perhaps, the
most accurate method. Its disadvantage lies in
the fact that whereas the heavier and more robust
apparatus needed for it can easily be employed
in the stationary beacon stations, few
aircraft will be able to support wireless sending
apparatus of sufficient weight to carry over
the long distances they must cover in trans-oceanic
aërial travel.</p>

<p>The greatest advantage of air navigation by
means of wireless telegraphy is that it can be
employed in any weather. Fogs and clouds do
not make it inoperative, nor even less accurate.
Another recommendation is that its use does not
entail a knowledge of advanced mathematics, as
required for navigation by astronomical observation.</p>

<p>I believe firmly that the air navigator of the
future will rely upon the Wireless Direction
Finder as his mainstay, while using astronomical
observation and the system of "Dead
Reckoning" as checks upon the wireless bearings
given him, and as second and third strings
to his bow, in case the wireless receiving apparatus
breaks down.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br /><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Future of Transatlantic Flight</small></span><br /><br /></h2>


<p>Although three pioneer flights were
made across the Atlantic during the summer
of 1919, the year passed without bringing
to light any immediate prospect of an air service
between Europe and America. Nor does
1920 seem likely to produce such a development
on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Before a transatlantic airway is possible,
much remains to be done&mdash;organization, capitalization,
government support, the charting of
air currents, the establishment of directional
wireless stations, research after improvements
in the available material. All this requires the
spending of money; and for the moment neither
governments nor private interests are enamored
of investments with a large element of
speculation.</p>

<p>But, sooner or later, a London-New York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>service of aircraft must be established. Its advantages
are too tremendous to be ignored for
long. Prediction is ever dangerous; and,
meantime, I am confining myself to a discussion
of what can be done with the means and
the knowledge already at the disposal of experts,
provided their brains are allied to sufficient
capital.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the first two flights
across the Atlantic were made respectively by
a flying-boat and an aëroplane, it is very evident
that the future of transatlantic flight belongs
to the airship. That the apparatus in
which Sir John Alcock and I made the first non-stop
air journey over the Atlantic was an aëroplane
only emphasizes my belief that for long
flights above the ocean the dirigible is the only
useful vehicle. If science discovers some startlingly
new motive power&mdash;for example, intermolecular
energy&mdash;that will revolutionize mechanical
propulsion, heavier-than-air craft may
be as valuable for long flights as for air traffic
over shorter distances. Until then trans-ocean
flying on a commercial basis must be monopolized
by lighter-than-air craft.</p>

<p>The aëroplane&mdash;and in this general term I include
the flying boat and the seaplane&mdash;is impracticable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>as a means of transport for distances
over one thousand miles, because it has
definite and scientific limitations of size, and
consequently of lift. The ratio of weight to
power would prevent a forty-ton aëroplane&mdash;which
is approximately the largest heavier-than-air
craft that at present might be constructed
and effectively handled&mdash;from remaining
aloft in still air for longer than twenty-five
hours, carrying a load of passengers and mails
of about five tons at an air speed of, say, eighty-five
miles an hour. Its maximum air distance,
without landing to replenish the fuel supply,
would thus be two thousand, one hundred and
twenty-five miles. For a flight of twenty-five
hundred miles all the disposable lift (gross lift
minus weight of structure) would be needed for
crew and fuel, and neither passengers nor
freight could be taken aboard.</p>

<p>There is not in existence an aëroplane capable
of flying, without alighting on the way, the
three thousand miles between London and New
York, even when loaded only with the necessary
crew. With the very smallest margin of
safety no transatlantic route of over two thousand
miles is admissible for aëroplanes. This
limitation would necessitate time-losing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>wearisome journeys between London and Ireland,
Newfoundland and New York, to and
from the nearest points on either side of the
ocean. Even under these conditions only important
mail or valuable articles of little weight
might be carried profitably.</p>

<p>As against these drawbacks, the larger types
of airships have a radius far wider than the
Atlantic. Their only limit of size is concerned
with landing grounds and sheds; for the percentage
of useful lift increases with the bulk
of the vessel, while the weight to power ratio
decreases. A voyage by dirigible can therefore
be made directly from London to New
York, and far beyond it, without a halt.</p>

<p>Another advantage of lighter-than-air craft
is that whereas the restricted space on board an
aëroplane leaves little for comfort and convenience,
a large rigid airship can easily provide
first-rate living, sleeping and dining quarters,
besides room for the passengers to take exercise
by walking along the length of the inside keel,
or on the shelter deck. In a saloon at the top
of the vessel no noise from the engines would
be heard, as must be the case in whatever quarters
could be provided on a passenger aëroplane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet another point in favor of the airship as
a medium for trans-ocean flight is its greater
safety. An aëroplane is entirely dependent
for sustentation in the air on the proper working
of all its motors. Should two motors&mdash;in
some cases even one&mdash;break down, the result
would be a forced descent into the water, with
the possibility of total loss on a rough sea, even
though the craft be a solid flying boat. In the
case of an airship the only result of the failure
of any of the motors is reduction of speed.
Moreover, a speed of four-fifths of the maximum
can still be maintained with half the motors
of an airship out of action, so that there is
no possibility of a forced descent owing to engine
breakdown. The sole result of such a mishap
would be to delay the vessel's arrival.
Further, it may be noted that an airship's machinery
can be so arranged as to be readily accessible
for repairs and replacement while on
a voyage.</p>

<p>As regards comparative speed the heavy type
of aëroplane necessary to carry an economical
load for long distances would not be capable of
much more than eighty-five to ninety miles an
hour. The difference between this and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>present airship speed of sixty miles an hour
would be reduced by the fact that an aëroplane
must land at intermediate stations for fuel replenishment.
Any slight advantage in speed
that such heavier-than-air craft possess will disappear
with the future production of larger
types of dirigible, capable of cruising speeds
varying from seventy-five to ninety miles an
hour. For the airship service London-New
York direct, the approximate time under normal
conditions should be fifty hours. For the
aëroplane service London-Ireland-Newfoundland-New
York the time would be at least forty-six
hours.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most convincing argument in
favor of airships as against aëroplanes for
trans-ocean aviation is that of comparative cost.
All air estimates under present conditions must
be very approximate; but I put faith in the
carefully prepared calculations of experts of
my acquaintance. These go to show that, with
the equipment likely to be available during the
next few years, a regular and effective air service
between London and New York will need
(again emphasizing the factor of approximation)
the following capital and rates:</p>

<p>The weight available for passengers and
mails on each airship of the type projected
would be fifteen tons. This permits the carrying
of one hundred and forty passengers and
effects, or ten tons of mails and fifty passengers.
To cover the working costs and interest,
passengers would have to be charged $240 per
head and mails $2,025 per ton for the voyage
London-New York.</p>

<p>This charge for passengers is already less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>than that for the more expensive berths on
transatlantic liners. Without a doubt, with the
coming of cheaper fuel, lower insurance rates
and larger airships, it will be reduced eventually
to the cheapest rate for first-class passages
on sea liners.</p>

<p>With a fleet of four airships, a service of
two trips each way per week is easily possible.
For aëroplanes with a total load of forty tons
the weight available for passengers and mails
is 2.1 tons. If such a craft were to carry the
same weekly load as the service of airships&mdash;thirty
tons each way&mdash;it would be necessary to
have fourteen machines continually in commission.
Allowing for one hundred per cent.
spare craft as standby for repairs and overhaul,
twenty-eight aëroplanes would be required.
The approximate cost of such a service is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It will be seen from the above that the direct running
cost is 38%, and the overhead charges 62% of
the total cost.</p></blockquote>

<p>With a weight of 2.1 tons available on each
machine for passengers and mails twenty passengers
might be carried. To cover the working
costs and interest they must be charged
$575 per head. The rate for mails would be
$5,500 per ton.</p>

<p>Having made clear that the airship is the only
means of transatlantic flight on a paying basis,
the next point to be considered is the type of
dirigible necessary. A discussion at present of
the size of the airships that will link Europe and
America can be little more substantial than
guesswork. The British dirigible <i>R-34</i>, which
last year made the famous pioneer voyage between
England and the United States, is too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>small for commercial purposes, with its disposable
lift of twenty-nine tons and its gas capacity
of less than two million cubic feet. Experts
have predicted the use of airships of five million
and ten million cubic feet capacity, with
respective weights of thirty tons and one hundred
tons available for passengers and freight.</p>

<p>It is probable, however, that such colossi
must await birth for many years, and that a beginning
will be made with moderate-sized craft
of about three million, five hundred thousand
cubic feet capacity, similar to those that serve
as the basis of the estimates for a service between
London and New York. A combination
of British interests is planning to send ships of
this type all over the world. These can be built
immediately, and there are already in existence
suitable sheds to house them. Details of their
structure and capabilities may be of interest.</p>

</div>



<p>The projected airship of three million, five
hundred thousand cubic feet capacity is capable
of carrying a useful load of fifteen tons (passengers
and mails) for a distance of forty-eight
hundred miles in eighty hours, at the normal
cruising speed. The total lifting power is one
hundred and five tons, and the disposable lift
(available for fuel, oil, stores, crew, passengers
and freight) is sixty-eight tons. The maximum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>engine power is thirty-five hundred h. p., the
maximum speed seventy-five miles an hour.
The normal flying speed, using a cruising power
of two thousand h. p., is sixty miles an hour.
The overall length is eight hundred feet, the
maximum diameter and width one hundred feet,
and the overall height one hundred and five feet.
These particulars and performances are based
on present design, and on the results attained
with ships of two million cubic feet capacity,
now in service. The figures are conservative,
and it is probable that a disposable lift greater
than that of the specifications will be obtained
as a result of improved structural efficiency.</p>

<p>The passenger accommodation will be such
that the air journey can be made in comfort
equal to that on a first-class liner of the sea.
Apart from their comparatively small disposable
lift, a main objection to vessels of the <i>R-34</i>
type for commercial purposes is that the living
quarters are in cars slung from under the middle
envelope. In this position they are necessarily
rather cramped. In the proposed craft
of three million, five hundred thousand cubic
feet capacity the passengers' quarters are at
the top of the vessel. There, they will be roomy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>and entirely free from the vibration of the engines.
They are reached through an internal
corridor across the length of the ship, or by
elevator, from the bottom of it.</p>

<p>The main room is a large saloon lounge fitted
with tables and chairs in the style of a Pullman
car. Around it are windows, allowing for daylight
and for an outlook in every direction.
Part of it is fire-proofed, and serves as a smoking
room.</p>

<p>Next to, and communicating with, the lounge
is the dining saloon. This leads to a serving
hatch and electrical cooking apparatus. Electrical
power is provided by dynamos driven off
the main engines. Current for electric lighting
and heating of the saloons, cars and sleeping
quarters is provided by the same method.</p>

<p>Sleeping accommodation is in four-berth and
two-berth cabins on top of the airship and forward
of the living saloons. The cabins are of
the type and size fitted on ocean-going steamers.
With them are the usual bathrooms and
offices. Other conveniences are an open shelter
deck at the vessel's aft end, to enable passengers
to take the air, and an observation car, fitted
below the hull and also at the aft end, so
that they can observe the land or sea directly
below them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>No danger from fire need be feared. The machinery
installation is carefully insulated from
the gas bags, and the quarters are to be rendered
fire-proof and gas-proof. Moreover, the
amount of weight involved by the passengers'
section is so small, compared with the weight
of the machinery, fuel, cargo and stores, carried
in the lower part of the craft, that the stability
of the ship for rolling is unaffected by the novel
position of the living quarters.</p>

<p>The ship's officers will have on the hull, towards
the forward end, a control and navigation
compartment, containing the main controls,
navigation instruments, charts, and a cabin for
the wireless telegraphy installation. The windows
of this car give a clear view in every
direction.</p>

<p>Other general specifications are:</p>

<p><i>Hull Structure.</i>&mdash;The shape of the hull is of
the most perfect stream-line form within the
limitations of constructional requirements. An
internal keel corridor, running along the bottom
of the hull, contains all petrol and oil tanks and
the water ballast.</p>

<p><i>Outer Covering.</i>&mdash;The outer cover is made of
special weather-proof fabric, which gives the
longest possible life. This fabric is as efficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>as possible in insulating the gas from change of
temperature, and thus avoids great variations
in the lift.</p>

<p><i>Gasbags.</i>&mdash;The gas capacity is divided up into
gasbags made of suitable rubber-proofed cotton
fabric, lined with gold-beaters' skins. Gasbags
will be fitted to automatic relief valves and hand
control maneuvering valves.</p>

<p><i>Machinery Cars.</i>&mdash;Six machinery cars are
provided, each containing one engine installation,
with a direct-driven propeller fitted at the
aft end. These compartments give the mechanics
easy access to each of the six engines, and
allow them to handle all parts of the machinery.
Engine room telegraphs of the electrical type
communicate between the forward compartment
and each of the machinery cars.</p>

<p>Whereas the living quarters and the control
compartment must be heated by electric radiators,
arrangements can be made to warm the
machinery cars by utilizing the exhaust heat.
The transmission gear in two of the wing cars
is to be fitted with reversing gear, so that the
craft may be driven astern. So that passengers
shall not be worried by the usual roar of the
exhaust, special silencers will be fitted. The
transmission gear is also so arranged that all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>unnecessary clamor from it may be avoided.</p>

<p>The engines run on gasoline fuel, but they
have devices whereby they can be run alternatively
on hydrogen gas. They are designed to
develop their maximum power at a height of
five thousand feet.</p>

<p><i>Telephones.</i>&mdash;Telephone communication links
all stations on the airship.</p>

<p><i>Landing Gear.</i>&mdash;Inflated buffer landing bags
of a special type are to be fitted underneath the
Forward Control Compartment and underneath
the two Aft Machinery Cars. These enable
the airship to alight either on land or on
the sea's surface.</p>

<p><i>Wireless Telegraphy.</i>&mdash;A powerful wireless
telegraphy installation is to be fitted in the wireless
cabin in the forward control compartment.
It will have a range for sending and receiving
of at least five thousand miles.</p>

<p><i>Crew.</i>&mdash;Two watches would be required, taking
duty in eight-hour shifts. Both must be on
duty when the craft leaves or lands. Each
watch consists of navigating officer, steersman,
elevator man, four engineers and a wireless
operator. With the commanding officer and two
stewards, whose duties are not regulated by
watches, the crew thus numbers nineteen men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>Although the speed of the airship at maximum
power is seventy miles per hour, the crossing
normally would be made at sixty miles per
hour, which only requires two thousand horse
power, and is much more economical in fuel.
The full speed, however, can be used whenever
the ship is obliged to voyage through storm
areas or against strong head winds. By the
Azores route, the time needed for the journey
of thirty-six hundred miles, at a speed of sixty
miles per hour, is sixty hours; but to allow for
delays owing to adverse weather, the airship
would always carry eighty hours' fuel, allowing
for a speed of sixty miles per hour. The
normal time for the journey from London to
New York, via Portugal and the Azores (thirty-six
hundred miles) would be, therefore, two and
one half days. The normal time for the journey
New York to London by the direct route (three
thousand miles) would be just over two days.</p>

<p>The prevailing wind on the direct route is almost
always from West to East, which favors
the Eastbound journey, but is unfavorable to
the Westbound journey. It is proposed that
the crossing Eastward from New York to London
be made by the most direct route, advantage
thus being taken of the Westerly winds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>By making the Westbound journey on the
Southerly route, via the Coast of Portugal and
the Azores, and on 35´ N. parallel of latitude
across the Atlantic, and then to New York, the
voyage is made in a region where the prevailing
Westerly winds of the higher latitudes are absent,
and only light winds are encountered, generally
of a favorable direction. This route,
however, adds about six hundred miles to the
distance. With a ship speed of sixty miles per
hour, it would be quicker to make the Westbound
journey by the direct route if the Westerly
wind did not exceed ten miles per hour. If
the wind were greater, time would be saved by
covering the extra six hundred miles of the
Southerly route and dodging the unfavorable
air currents.</p>

<p>With four airships on the Cross-Atlantic airway,
two only would be in service at a time,
so that each could lay up during alternate weeks
for overhaul and re-fit. As the time of journey
between London and New York will vary between
fifty to sixty hours, each airship can
easily make two crossings or one double journey
per week, thus giving a service, with two dirigibles,
of two "sailings" each way per week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>The average time table might therefore be as
follows:</p>

<p>From available weather reports, it is considered
that crossings are practicable on at least
three hundred days in the year. Probably a
total of two hundred crossings in the year could
be maintained. Until further study of weather
conditions supplies a certain knowledge of the
best possible altitudes and latitudes, it is likely
that a regular service of two crossings each way
per week will be maintained only in the months
of May to September, and that the crossings
from October to April will be irregular, the day
of departure being dependent on the weather.</p>

<p>Weather difficulties are likely to be much less
severe than might be imagined. Rain, hail and
snow should have little influence on the navigation
of airships. An outer covering that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>is rainproof and non-absorbent avoids the absorption
of water and the consequent increase
of weight. Hail and snow cannot adhere to the
surface of the craft when in flight, owing to its
high speed through the air; and, in any case,
the precipitation height being not more than
eight thousand feet, they can be avoided by flying
above this altitude.</p>

<p>Fog may give trouble in landing, but during
the journey an airship can keep above it. If the
terminal were enveloped by fog an arriving
ship could pass on to an emergency landing
ground away from the fog-belt; if the mistiness
were slight, it could remain in the air until the
ground were visible, making use of its margin
of fuel beyond the amount necessary for the
London-New York flight. Airships in fog may
be enabled to find their landing ground by
means of captive balloons or kites, and of strong
searchlights from the ground. At night, the
balloons or kites could carry electric lights, with
connections from the aërodrome.</p>

<p>In any case, fog, rain, hail and snow are
nearly always local in their occurrence, and can
be avoided by a short deviation from the usual
route. Atlantic records indicate that on the
main steamship routes fog sufficient to impede
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>navigation does not occur on more than about
twelve days in the year.</p>

<p>Wind is a factor that needs more careful
study in its relation to transatlantic air navigation.
In most cases, unduly strong winds can be
dodged by flying on a higher level, or by cruising
on a different course, so as to avoid the
storm belt. Heavy storms, which are usually
of a cyclonic nature, rarely cover an area of
more than two hundred miles diameter. Moreover,
the rate of progression of a cyclonic area
is much less than the speed of the air movement.
An airship is able to shake off a cyclonic area
by a deviation from its course of not more than
two hundred miles. Once away from the storm
belt, it has no difficulty in keeping clear of it.</p>

<p>When higher levels of the air have been
charted, there is every reason to believe that
the known movements of the Atlantic winds
will be used to shorten air journeys. There are
at sea level, between certain clearly defined
latitudes, prevailing winds of constant direction.
At greater heights, also, there is in most
latitudes a constant drift which, if charted,
might be useful even if winds at sea level were
unfavorable.</p>

<p>Although precise information is available of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>the prevailing and periodic winds at sea level
in various latitudes, very little coördinated
work appears to have been done in charting the
prevailing and seasonal winds in higher levels
of the atmosphere. Observations of the air currents
over various localities in the United
States, England and Germany have been taken,
but very little is known of the winds above the
great ocean tracts. There is a great necessity
for international research to provide data for
predictions of weather conditions in the upper
atmosphere and thus enable advantage to be
taken of these higher currents.</p>

<p>At high altitudes, constant winds of from
thirty to forty miles per hour are common. If
the prevailing directions of those were known to
airship navigators, the duration of the journey
could be considerably shortened, even if this
meant taking an indirect route. It is undesirable
to fly at great heights owing to the low temperature;
but with suitable provision for heating
there is no reason why flying at ten thousand
feet should not be common.</p>

<p>Air currents cannot be charted as exactly as
sea currents; but much valuable work can and
will be done by tabulating in detail, for the
guidance of air navigators, the tendencies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>the Atlantic atmospheric drifts. Reliable
charts, used in conjunction with directional
messages from wireless stations and ships, may
make it possible for vessels on the London-New
York air service always to avoid troublesome
winds, as well as storms and fogs, and to reduce
the percentage of risk to a figure not exceeding
that relative to sea liners.</p>

<p>For the rest, the excellence of the most modern
engines and the fact that one or two, or even
three of them can be temporarily out of action
without affecting the airship's stability during
a flight, minimize the danger of a breakdown
from loss of power. The only remaining obstacle
to reasonable safety would seem to be in
landing on and departing from the terminal
during rough weather. This can be overcome
by the recently patented Vickers Mooring Gear
for Rigid Airships.</p>

<p>The gear, designed so as to permit an airship
to land and remain moored in the open for extended
periods in any weather without the use
of sheds, consists principally of a tall steel mast
or tower, about one hundred and fifty feet in
height, with a revolving head to which the craft
is rigidly attached by the nose, permitting it to
ride clear of the ground and to turn round in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>accordance with the direction of the wind. It is
provided with a hauling-in winch and rope to
bring the ship up to the mooring point.</p>

<p>An elevator, for passengers and goods, runs
up the tower from the ground to the platform
adjoining the nose of the airship. The
passengers reach their quarters along a passage
through the vessel, and the goods are taken
down a runway. An airship moored to this
mast can remain unharmed in even the worst
weather, and need be taken into a shed only
when overhaul and repairs are necessary.</p>

<p>In discussing the future of transatlantic flight
I have confined myself to the projected service
between London and New York. There is likely
to be another route over the Atlantic&mdash;London
to Rio de Janeiro, via Lisbon and Sierra Leone.
Already in London tickets are on sale at $5,000
apiece for the first flight from London to Rio.
This, of course, is a freak price, which covers
the distinction of being in the first airship to
travel from England to Brazil. If and when a
regular London-Rio service is established, the
ordinary passenger rate should be little more
than the $240 estimated as the air fare on the
London-New York route.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be that the London-New York air service
will not arrive for many years. Sooner or
later, however, it must arrive; for science, allied
to human enterprise, never neglects a big idea.
It may be that, when it does arrive, the structure
of the craft and the methods of navigation
applied to them will differ in important details
from what I have indicated. I make no pretense
at prophecy, but have merely tried to
show how, with the means already at hand,
moderately priced air journeys from Europe to
America can be made in two to two and a half
days, with comfort, safety and a high degree of
reliability. Meanwhile, much depends on the
funds available for the erection of stations for
directional wireless messages, on research into
the air currents at various levels above the Atlantic
Ocean, on the courage of capitalists in
promoting what seems to be a very speculative
enterprise, and on new adaptations of old mechanical
inventions.</p>

<p>Already hundreds of aëroplanes, as time-saving
vehicles, are used regularly in many countries
for commercial traffic over comparatively
short distances&mdash;the carriage of mails, passengers,
valuable freight and urgent special journeys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>When, but not until, the hundreds become
thousands, and the longer distances are as
well served by airships as are the shorter distances
by aëroplanes, the world's air age will
be in sight.</p>

<p>Although facts disappointed many over-sanguine
expectations that the billions of
dollars invested in aëronautics during the war
would pay direct dividends already in 1919, the
year brought us a long step nearer the age of
universal flight. Meantime, commercial aviation
is still a long way from the stage at which
bankers regard its undertakings as good security
for loans.</p>

<p>Air routes have been opened up in most parts
of the world. Captain Ross-Smith has shown,
by his magnificent journey from England to
Australia in a Vickers-Vimy aëroplane, that
long-distance flights over the most out-of-the-way
lands and ocean tracts can be made even
under the present unsatisfactory conditions, before
terminals, landing grounds and wireless
stations are provided for air pilots and navigators.
The Atlantic has been crossed four times,
twice by a dirigible, once by an aëroplane and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>once by a flying boat. Aëroplanes have flown
from England to India. Aircraft have been
used for commercial purposes in every part of
Western Europe, in most countries of North
and South America, in Australia, India, Egypt
and South Africa. Important exhibitions of
modern aircraft, similar to automobile shows,
have been held in London, New York, Paris,
Amsterdam and elsewhere.</p>

<p>To-day all the Great Powers can show commercial
air services in full operation. Of these
the most important are perhaps the triangular
airways around London, Paris and Brussels.
One French and two British companies operate
daily between London and Paris; British craft
travel backwards and forwards between London
and Brussels three times a week; and
French machines fly between Paris and Brussels
every day.</p>

<p>The London-Paris services have established a
magnificent record for efficiency and regularity.
Valuable and urgent freight of every kind, including
furs, dresses, jewelry, documents, a
bunch of keys, perfume, a grand piano and even
a consignment of lobsters, have been delivered
in safety. Forty pounds of assorted London
newspapers are taken each morning to Paris,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>where they are sold in the streets on the day of
publication instead of next morning, as was the
case when they were forwarded by train and
packet-boat. Leading London papers, such as
the <i>Times</i>, the <i>Telegraph</i>, the <i>Morning Post</i>, the
<i>Daily Mail</i>, and the <i>Daily Express</i>, have regular
contracts with one of the companies.</p>

<p>As for passengers, men of every occupation
take advantage of the opportunity to travel
comfortably from London to Paris in two and
one-quarter hours. There is seldom a vacant
seat on the larger machines; although the fare
is at present rather high, ranging from $75 to
$105 for the single journey.</p>

<p>Moreover, the accommodation on two of the
types of aëroplane now used&mdash;the Handley-Page
<i>W-8</i> and the Airco <i>DH-18</i>&mdash;is more
attractive than that of a Pullman car. The
Handley-Page <i>W-8</i> carries fifteen to twenty
passengers with personal luggage, or two tons
of freight. The Airco <i>DH-18</i> takes eight passengers,
with their personal luggage.</p>

<p>The past year saw no specially important developments
of commercial aviation inside Great
Britain itself. A week-end service between
Southampton and Havre was inaugurated, and
passengers and mails were flown from London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>to Leeds. The most important undertaking was
perhaps the delivery by air of newspapers. For
a time the Manchester edition of the <i>Daily
Mail</i> was taken by air for distribution in Carlisle,
Dundee and Aberdeen, the last-named
place being reached in three and one-quarter
hours instead of the thirteen hours of train
journey. Evening newspapers were carried
daily during the summer from London to various
resorts on the South coast.</p>

<p>The London-Leeds undertaking is the only
regular service between English towns that has
lasted for long. Elsewhere the air rates proved
to be too high, and although there were plenty
of aërodromes, the promoters of aërial transport
companies could not compete with the all-embracing
network of railways. During the
great railway strike of October, however, valuable
transport work was done by aircraft. For
the rest, aëroplanes in England are chartered
as aërial taxicabs for special trips, and last
summer one or two companies reaped a moderate
harvest by organizing pleasure trips at
the seaside resorts. An airship or two have
taken tours around the battlefields of France
and Flanders. A few wealthy amateurs have
bought aëroplanes for their private use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>Other European countries&mdash;France, Italy,
Holland, Belgium, Scandinavia, Spain and Portugal&mdash;have
made rather less progress in the
manufacture and development of aëroplanes or
dirigibles; but their use of aircraft for commercial
purposes was about the same as that of
Britain&mdash;newspaper distribution, some special
journeys, and many joyrides. French aviators
have opened tentative airways to Morocco,
Senegal and Tunis. For regular passenger or
goods services in continental Europe the high
cost of fuel and accessories makes the rates too
high. Also aërodromes and landing grounds
are too few; and seldom can aëroplanes compete
on a large scale with railways over comparatively
short distances. Exceptions are the
Paris-Lyons and Madrid-Lisbon airways.</p>

<p>Germany, throughout what was for her a terrible
year, made further progress with her
Zeppelin dirigibles. A number of return voyages
were made over the route Berlin-Munich-Vienna-Constantinople.
The latest type of Zeppelin
is so efficient that no weather conditions,
except a strong cross-hangar wind, prevents the
airship <i>Bodensee</i> from making its daily flight of
three hundred and ninety miles between Friedrichshafen
and Staalsen, thirteen miles from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>Berlin. The passenger carrying Zeppelins,
which prior to the war provided the only important
example of commercial aircraft, claim
a remarkable record. They have carried more
than one hundred and forty thousand people,
and yet not one of the passengers has been
killed or injured in an accident; although some
members of the crews lost their lives in the
early days of the pioneer Zeppelins.</p>

<p>The vast distances of the United States offer
better opportunities for aëroplane traffic than
the comparatively small and closely-railwayed
countries of Western Europe. There is no
doubt that, had the United States government
supported its aircraft companies to the same
extent as did the British government, commercial
aviation in America would have traveled
along a smooth road. Even without this support
it has made excellent progress. Successful
regular services are established between Los
Angeles and San Diego, and elsewhere in the
West, and in the East many passengers have
been carried between New York and Atlantic
City, and around the coast of Florida. Plans
are being laid for various other airways, including
one between Key West and Havana.</p>

<p>While no continuous service for aërial goods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>traffic exist in the United States, aëroplanes are
often chartered for special deliveries. This is
particularly the case in the oil countries of
Texas and Oklahoma, where newly-grown and
important centers are off the beaten railroad
track. One company in Oklahoma regularly
sends its employees' pay by aëroplane from
town to oilfield camp, thus assuring a quick and
safe delivery, free from the necessity of armed
guards and the danger of hold-ups. Other items
worth noting in the United States' aërial history
of the past twelve months are that aëroplanes
have performed survey work and located
forest fires, that thirty-two cities have applied
for commercial aërodromes for postal, passenger
and express purposes, and that an advertising
agency is soliciting aërial business that will
include display work on dirigibles, balloons and
aëroplanes, the dropping of pamphlets from the
air, and aërial photography.</p>

<p>Where the United States undoubtedly leads
the way is in the ownership and use of privately
owned aëroplanes&mdash;a circumstance partly explained
by the great quantities of new money
being spent. For a time some of the American
manufacturers were months behind their post-war
orders, and were selling everything that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>could fly. One famous company disposed of
hundreds of pleasure craft at $7,500 apiece.
Many buyers, impatient of delay, accepted immediate
delivery of training machines, rather
than wait for the pleasure craft. Reputable
agencies dealing in second-hand aëroplanes
bought from the United States and Canadian
governments, disposed of thousands of machines
and could not obtain enough to satisfy
all their clients. An interesting development
was the idea of community aëroplanes, purchased
and maintained jointly by small groups
of people living in the same residential district.</p>

<p>The United States postal authorities have
satisfactorily maintained aërial mail services
over the route New York-Washington-Cleveland-Chicago.
After some preliminary fiascos
these became reliable, besides being very
speedy, as compared with train schedules. For
June the Washington-New York air mail
achieved ninety-nine per cent. efficiency, and the
Cleveland-Chicago route one hundred per cent.
The latter never missed a day in May and June,
and not a single forced landing occurred during
the first seventy days. At the close of 1919
the air mails showed a surplus of $19,000 of
revenue over working costs, on a basis of two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>cents charge for each ounce of mail matter carried.
Better results are expected now that
specially constructed machines, with freight
capacities of one thousand pounds and upward,
are ready for use.</p>

<p>The British dominions and dependencies take
a great interest in aëronautics, and last year
saw satisfactory beginnings in some of them.
In Australia, for example, a passenger and
freight service links Sydney and Port Darwin,
over a distance of twenty-five hundred miles,
with intervening stations. Plans are ready for
regular flights from North to South of the continent,
and also from East to West, across the
difficult country between New South Wales and
Victoria on the one hand, and Western Australia
on the other.</p>

<p>Canada has found a highly successful use for
aëroplanes in prospecting the Labrador timber
country. A group of machines returned from
an exploration with valuable photographs and
maps of hundreds of thousands of dollars'
worth of forest land. Aërial fire patrols, also,
have been sent out over the forests. While no
important air route for passenger carrying is
yet utilized in Canada, there is a certain amount
of private flying, and air journeys for business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>purposes are common. Plans have been prepared
for a regular service between Newfoundland
and cities on the mainland, thus saving
many hours over the time schedules perpetrated
by the little Newfoundland railway.</p>

<p>In the South African Union, where the railway
system by no means corresponds with the
vast distances, many passengers and mails are
carried by air from Johannesburg to Pretoria,
Maritzburg, Durban and Cape Town. Later,
when the services over these routes are better
organized, they will doubtless be extended to
important centers in Rhodesia, the East Africas
and what was German South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Aëroplanes in India take passengers over the
route Calcutta-Simla in twelve to fourteen
hours of cool roominess, as compared with
forty-two hours of stuffy oppressiveness on a
train. Other Indian air routes in preparation
are Calcutta-Bombay, Calcutta-Darjeeling and
Calcutta-Puri. The air fare in India averages
about 11 cents a mile.</p>

<p>Aërodromes and landing grounds are already
prepared between Egypt and India, and several
machines have made the journey from Cairo to
Delhi, via Damascus, the Syrian Desert, Bagdad,
Bandar Abbas and Karachi. Elsewhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>in the East&mdash;the Malay Peninsula, Singapore,
Borneo, Java and China&mdash;similar routes are
planned. The whole of Eastern Africa, from
Cairo to Cape Town, has been mapped out for
the use of aircraft, with landing grounds at
short intervals.</p>

<p>So much for accomplishment during the past
year. What the future and the near-future
have in store for aëronautics is problematical,
and any detailed analysis must be conjecture.
The general trend of development during the
next two years may be forecast, however, with a
fair degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>Anybody who blends sane imagination with
some knowledge of the history of aëronautics
must realize that what has been achieved is very
little in comparison with what can be achieved.
It is unnecessary to make trite comparisons
with the first stages of steam locomotives or
motor cars.</p>

<p>Yet, it is folly to expect an air age now. Its
coming will be delayed by the necessity of slow,
painstaking research, and by the fact that in the
countries which are encouraging aviation to the
greatest degree, capital is no longer fluid and
plentiful, and money in substantial sums cannot
be risked on magnificent experiments. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>cost of building fleets of dirigibles and hosts of
air terminals, for example, must be enormous;
and until it has been demonstrated beyond question
that they will be paying propositions, financiers
and investors are unlikely to be interested
in their concrete possibilities on a large scale.</p>

<p>Unless some startling innovation&mdash;a much
cheaper fuel for example, or a successful helicopter&mdash;revolutionizes
commercial aviation, its
near-future is unlikely to stray beyond the extension
of airways over distances of about five
hundred to two thousand miles. These are
likely to be covered mostly by heavier-than-air
craft, although, as in Germany, dirigibles will
have their place.</p>

<p>Extension of air traffic is especially probable
in industrial and agricultural countries of large
area, such as the United States, Canada, Australia,
India and the South American republics.
Another projected development with immediate
possibilities is the linking of regions that are
separated by a comparatively narrow expanse
of water. Obvious examples, in addition to
Britain and France, are England and Ireland,
the Mediterranean coast of France and the
Mediterranean coast of Africa, and Florida and
Cuba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>Traffic across the ocean or a great lake offers
to air travel the best time-saving inducement.
To connect two places separated by one hundred
and fifty miles of water, an average steamship
needs ten hours. A passenger on it must
spend at least one night away from home, while
transacting his business. An air passenger
covers the same distance in one and one-half to
two hours, and can return on the same day.
For such transport the seaplane and the flying
boat will have their chance.</p>

<p>Besides the carriage of passengers, mails and
valuable freight, aviation will have many additional
functions. Maps may be made and
checked with absolute accuracy by means of
aërial photography. Another important function
of the aëroplane and the aërial camera is
to explore and prospect undeveloped districts.
In places remote from the ordinary facilities of
civilization aircraft may be used for the discovery
of fire, flood and lawlessness. Already
the Canadian Northwest Mounted Police have
captured wrongdoers by means of aëroplane patrols.</p>

<p>Aircraft offer particular advantages as carriers
in regions where the natural obstacles on
the ground prohibit railway or road transport.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>In Alaska valuable metals and furs are brought
to civilization on sleds drawn by dogs, over
paths that are circuitous and dangerous. They
could be taken in safety, and with an immense
saving of time, by aëroplanes fitted with skids
suitable for landing on ice and snow. Again,
copper is transported from mines in the Andes
by llamas, which are slow and must jog over
devious tracks. Aëroplanes could make the
journey directly and speedily, from mine to
coast, without regard to precipice, marsh or
forest.</p>

<p>South America is likely to be a happy hunting-ground
for aëronautical pioneers. The
mountain-range of the Andes, which for hundreds
of miles sharply divides America into two
parts, gives aviation an incontestable opportunity.
The eastern section of South America
could be brought days nearer the western section
by high-climbing aircraft, which would provide
a pleasant alternative to the roundabout,
uncomfortable journeying now necessary. The
air mails between the two great commercial
centers of South America&mdash;Rio de Janeiro and
Buenos Ayres&mdash;should also save many days of
valuable time. Many owners of ranches and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>plantations in the Argentine, Uruguay, Paraguay
and Brazil are buying aëroplanes to bring
their isolated, up-country properties in closer
contact with the towns.</p>

<p>Asia and Africa have similar geographical
problems, to which air traffic might find a ready
solution. Each of these continents has enormous
areas that, because of the absence of good
railways, are either unproductive or much less
productive than their resources warrant. A
few of many such cases are Turkestan, Central
Arabia, parts of China, Siberia, Thibet, and
the whole of Central Africa. Most of these are
rich in minerals. Meanwhile, aëroplanes have
flown between the desert marts of Damascus
and Bagdad in eight to ten hours. These cities
are not yet linked by railroad and a camel caravan
over the Syrian desert covers the same
route in two weeks to a month. The same conditions
apply to the Gobi desert.</p>

<p>So far I have dealt with the future of commercial
aëronautics almost entirely in terms of
heavier-than-air machines. These&mdash;land planes,
seaplanes and flying boats&mdash;have at present a
useful radius of non-stop flight confined to distances
of under one thousand miles. The limitation
must remain until changes in the basic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>principles of aëroplane construction are so altered
as to give a much greater speed in proportion
to fuel consumption. One such change
may be the introduction of wings with variable
camber. This, by permitting variations in the
angle of incidence, would make possible a quick
ascent at a steep inclination, and a very fast forward
speed once the required height had been
attained. The benefits from variable camber
could be increased by the introduction of a propeller
with a variable pitch. Going still further
in the same direction, we may find any day that
one of the attempts in various countries to design
and construct a successful helicopter has
matured, producing a machine which, by reason
of a very powerful propeller on a moveable
shaft that can be inclined in any direction,
will not only rise and descend vertically, but
also may be made to travel forward at a great
speed and to perform such acrobatic tricks as
sudden halts, retreats and jumps.</p>

<p>All this, however, is surmise; and we are
faced with the fact that until the design of aëroplanes
differs radically from its present form,
heavier-than-air flying apparatuses are limited
as to maximum size by certain structural principles
too complicated for explanation in this
non-technical analysis. A further limitation is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>imposed by the space needed by the largest
machines for leaving the ground or landing.</p>

<p>Within these bounds it has been found that
the maximum capacity for passengers and
freight does not greatly exceed one and one-half
to two tons for a non-stop journey of five
hundred miles in still air. Lesser distances do
not increase the useful load appreciably, but
greater distances decrease it; until for a radius
of about twenty-five hundred miles the whole
of the disposable lift is needed for fuel, and
nothing else may be carried.</p>

<p>For long journeys over land, therefore, the
aëroplane must come to earth for replenishment
of fuel every five hundred miles. Even for this
distance it cannot take more than one and one-half
to two tons beyond the weight of fuel and
crew. If heavier loads are to be transported,
more machines must be used. Finally there
comes a point at which a single airship, carrying
a heavy freight over five hundred miles, is
more economical than several aëroplanes. For
non-stop flights of over one thousand miles the
same considerations make the airship always
more economical than the aëroplane.</p>

<p>Over the ocean the flying boat can beat the
dirigible in time and cost up to five hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>miles. Even at one thousand miles it is a commercial
proposition, but it must then have all
in its favor. For longer distances the airship
has no competitor. It may be deduced that in
years to come, when the world's airways are in
general operation, heavier-than-air machines
will bring freight to the great airports, there
to be transferred to dirigibles and by them carried
to the earth's uttermost ends.</p>

<p>The time for this seeming Utopia is not yet,
however, although a group of airship interests
in England are now planning airship services
that may eventually set London within two and
a half days of New York, one and a half days
of Cairo, four of Rio de Janeiro, five and a half
of Cape Town and seven of Australia. But first
must come bold expenditure, very careful organization,
many-sided research and improved
invention.</p>

<p>Although no claim is made that present-day
airships can compete for reliability with railroad
trains and ocean liners, there is no doubt
that a sufficient number of passengers are prepared
to pay relatively higher rates for the
great saving in time taken for long distance
journeys, particularly over the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>The demand would be mainly for the carriage
of express freight and mail matter and for
passenger traffic to serve people who wish to
get from center to center in the shortest possible
time. Another use for large airships
would be the carrying of freight of high intrinsic
value, such as valuable ores, from places
otherwise inaccessible, or not provided with
other means of direct transport.</p>

<p>To meet the requirements of various purposes
for which airships may be utilized, dirigibles
of four kinds are projected:</p>

<p>First, the airship of moderate size and high
speed for carrying express, mails and passengers.</p>

<p>Secondly, the air liner solely for passenger
traffic, of a large size and speed.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the large airship of comparatively
slow speed, and great carrying capacity, for
general transport.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the small non-rigid airship for
private purchase and upkeep as an aërial yacht.</p>

</div>


<p>The rigid airship is as yet only at the beginning
of its development, particularly as regards
size and carrying capacity. The airship of
three million, five hundred thousand cubic feet
capacity, for immediate use on the fast passenger
services, carrying a load of passengers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>fifteen tons for a distance of forty-eight hundred
miles, might be built immediately, and
could be housed in sheds at present available.
As the lift and speed efficiency of a rigid airship
increases rapidly in proportion to the vessel's
size, it will be advantageous to use the
largest airships that can be economically operated.
A rigid dirigible able to carry fifty tons
of passengers and freight for ten thousand
miles at a speed of eighty miles an hour is quite
feasible; and the design and construction of
such an airship could be undertaken immediately
if it were justified by the demand for air
transport.</p>

<p>The ships of three million, five hundred thousand
cubic feet capacity, which can be housed
and flown for commercial purposes as soon as
the required terminals and navigational facilities
are ready, will approximate to those described
as being suitable for a transatlantic
service. If standardized for adaptation to all
conditions and world routes, they should be
capable of a non-stop flight of about eighty
hours, at an average speed of sixty miles an
hour.</p>

<p>To prevent wastage and reduce the running
costs, several economical devices for dealing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>with height equilibrium are needed. On long
flights the greatest problems are maintenance
of the airship at a constant height, and avoidance
of the loss of gas consequent on expansion
when the ship rises as it loses weight by the
consumption of fuel. Owing to the great variation
in temperature between day and night, the
ship becomes heavy at night owing to the lower
temperature, and light during the day, as a result
of the higher temperature. A discharge of
ballast at nightfall, and of gas in the morning,
is needed to keep it in equilibrium. To obviate
discharge of gas, and the necessity of starting
with a large weight of ballast, it is proposed
to run a proportion of the engines on hydrogen
fuel, so that the hydrogen can be consumed at
such a rate that the loss of lift equals the loss
of weight of fuel consumed by the other engines,
thus economically using hydrogen which otherwise
would be lost through the discharge of the
gas valves.</p>

<p>I make the supposition that hydrogen, and
not helium, will be the sustaining gas. For commercial
aviation it has many advantages, for
helium is dearer and rarer, and has about
twenty per cent. less lift. Contrary to general
belief, a flight in an airship filled with hydrogen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>subject to proper precautions, has no greater
fire risk than living near a gas factory. Helium
is a necessity only for airships used in war, as,
unlike hydrogen, it is not ignited by incendiary
bullets from hostile aircraft. The United States
has almost a monopoly of the world's quantitative
supply of helium, which fact should be a
tremendous asset in wartime.</p>

<p>The ballast difficulty can be met by apparatus
to condense the water of combustion from the
exhaust gases of the engines. Experiments
have shown that it is practicable to recover
water of slightly greater weight than the gasoline
fuel consumed, thus avoiding any variation
in lift due to gasoline consumption. Further,
water ballast could be picked up periodically
from the sea by descending and taking in water
through a pump suspended from a flexible hose,
or direct into tanks in the gondolas through sea-valves.</p>

<p>Still further reduction of running costs may
be effected by fuel economy. This would be
difficult with internal combustion engines of the
type in use at present, for greater thermal efficiency
(the ratio between the amount of heat
contained in the fuel consumed and the amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>of useful work delivered by the engine) necessitates
heavier machinery. The reduction in
gasoline consumption is thus offset by a decrease
in the disposable lift. It is probable that
a saving on large dirigibles might result from
substituting for the internal combustion method
of generating power engines that burn cheap
oils. Although such engines are much heavier,
and although the crude oils weigh a good deal
more than gasoline, the difference would be
more than covered on long flights, for gasoline
is nearly four times dearer than crude oil.
Moreover, the weight of oil actually consumed
would be about twenty per cent. less than that
of the gasoline burned by internal combustion
engines over the same distance.</p>

<p>The solution may be in the employment of
steam. For the rather low standards of horsepower
on which dirigibles are driven, heavy
steam engines of the ordinary type, although
much more reliable, would be less economical
than internal combustion engines, owing to the
latter's better thermal efficiency. Engineers are
attempting to evolve a light type of steam turbine
that will overcome this drawback.</p>

<p>Of equal importance to fuel economy is a better
system of airship navigation. This is similar
in principle to steamship navigation, but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>is made more complicated by the much greater
drift of atmospheric currents. Moreover, air
currents can never be charted as exactly as sea
currents. An excellent meteorological organization,
for reporting motions of the air at given
times, is therefore essential.</p>

<p>When flying over land a navigator can determine
the drift of his vessel by taking observation
on a suitable fixed point on the earth's surface,
and adjusting his compass course accordingly.
It is probable that a gyroscopic compass
will be the standard type for dirigibles. Many
aviators have experienced difficulties with the
magnetic compass on long flights; although it
has served me well always, especially on my
transatlantic flight as Captain Alcock's navigator.</p>

<p>Over the sea no fixed point is available, so
that the motion of the wind must be checked
periodically. One method is for the navigator
to make astronomical observations, and from
them deduce his position on the chart. Another
may be the use of bombs which ignite on the
water and give out a dense smoke or a bright
light, lasting for several minutes. During the
day the navigator sights on the smoke, and during
the night on the light, and thus discovers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>the wind's velocity and direction. An invention
that could simplify navigation would be some
form of ground-speed meter, showing at a
glance the rate of progress over the earth (as
distinct from air speed), with either a following
or a contrary wind.</p>

<p>The most valuable means of airship navigation
will be that of directional wireless. Communication
from two separate stations, which
could be either land terminals or stationary
ships in the ocean, gives the direction of the
transmitted wireless waves and signals to the
dirigible its bearings. The position is then laid
off on the chart, and the course regulated accordingly.
This method was used by the German
Zeppelins during the war.</p>

<p>Of equal importance to the structural and
navigational equipment of airships is the provision
of suitable terminals for each route.
These would require, among other necessities,
an aërodrome of about one mile square; a double
airship shed capable of housing two vessels; a
mooring-out tower; mechanical gear for transferring
an airship from the mooring tower to
the shed; hydrogen generating and storage
plant; repair workshops and stores; meteorological
offices; wireless telegraphy installation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>electrical night signaling and landing arrangements;
a station on the local railway from the
main part of the city; a hotel; a garage; and
customs and booking offices.</p>

<p>The aërodrome must be a short distance from
the city served by the airship service. If possible
it should be near a chemical works where
hydrogen could be produced as a by-product.
The ground would be preferably on a site remote
from hills and other topographical features
likely to cause air disturbances.</p>

<p>The double sheds for housing vessels of the
size specified, three million, five hundred thousand
cubic feet capacity, would have two berths,
the minimum dimensions of each of which must
be eight hundred and fifty feet long, one hundred
and fifty feet wide, and one hundred and
fifteen feet high. Their contents should include
hydrogen filling mains and gear for slinging
the airships from the roof when deflated for
overhaul. Special arrangements would be made
for rapid replenishment of the ships with gas,
fuel, and water ballast.</p>

<p>If no industrial supply of hydrogen were provided
by a nearby factory, the aërodrome
should have a generating plant capable of producing
fifty thousand cubic feet of hydrogen per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>hour. Gasometer storage, with a capacity of
about five hundred thousand cubic feet, is also
a necessity.</p>

<p>The meteorological office would issue weather
reports for the guidance of airship navigators,
and issue navigating instructions to them by
means of the wireless installation. The latter
should have a range of at least five thousand
miles.</p>

<p>Each aërodrome would be provided with
suitable electric light signals to indicate the
position of the landing ground to incoming ships
at night, as well as landing lights to point the
way to the mooring tower. Trolleys running
on guide rails, with electrically driven gear,
could move a dirigible from the tower to the
shed with a minimum of man power.</p>

<p>A suitable mooring tower constitutes an
enormous saving of time and labor. The Vickers
Patent Mooring Gear, which has been tested
satisfactorily, can be worked by half a dozen
men; whereas the old method of rope pulling
and dragging needs two to four hundred men
for landing an airship of three million, five hundred
thousand cubic feet capacity.</p>

<p>With existing methods, a rigid airship must
be housed in a suitable shed when not in flight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>The danger and difficulty of removing the ship
from its shed, and returning it safely thereto
after a journey, restricts the number of actual
flying days in the year to those on which such
operations can be performed without risk of
damage, although a modern rigid airship may
be in the air with efficiency and perfect safety in
practically any state of the weather. The Patent
Mooring Gear renders the landing independent
of the weather, while calling for the
attendance of only six men to actuate the various
mechanical devices employed.</p>

<p>In principle, the gear consists of a tall steel
mast, of such a height that when the ship is attached
by the nose it rides on an even keel at a
height of upwards of one hundred feet. The
mast has at the top a platform or deck. The
head of the tower is entirely enclosed and contains
the necessary apparatus for bringing a
vessel to rest. This top portion is designed to
rotate, so that a ship, when moored, may always
lie directly head to wind.</p>

<p>Access to the upper deck of the masthead is
obtained by means of an elevator, which allows
passengers to enter the ship in comfort. Behind
the deck is a compartment containing the
landing gear. This consists of an electrically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>driven winding engine, fitted with about one
thousand feet of the highest quality flexible
steel wire rope, together with any automatic
coupling. In the compartment are also pipes
for the supply to the ship of hydrogen, gasoline,
oil and water from the main reservoirs, situated
on the ground at the foot of the mast. The
vessel itself is fitted with apparatus complementary
to that housed in the masthead. From
the nose projects the attachment which is
gripped by the automatic coupling, while in the
bow is situated a storage drum and winch for
six hundred feet of wire rope.</p>

<p>On approaching the aërodrome, the ship wirelesses
its intention to land. The masthead
mooring rope is then threaded through the
automatic coupling, and paid out until the free
end reaches the ground below. This end of the
rope is attached by a shackle to the rear of a
light car, which is driven away from the mast
in the direction from which the ship is approaching,
while the rope uncoils from the drum
above. When at a distance of seven hundred or
eight hundred feet from the foot of the mast
the men in charge of the gear unshackle the
rope, and spread landing signs that indicate to
the airship pilot their position on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>On arrival over the landing party, the ship's
bow mooring rope is released, and runs out
from the bow attachment under the influence of
a weight of several hundred pounds in the form
of sandbags. Two men of the party on the
ground below take charge of the rope, unshackle
the sandbags, and effect a junction with
the mooring mast rope, which is in the hands
of the remaining men of the landing party. The
rope ends are coupled together by means of a
self-locking coupling, which enables the junction
to be made within five seconds.</p>

<p>The dirigible is now connected with the head
of the mooring mast by a long length of steel
wire rope. On receiving a signal from the
ground party, the men in charge of the winding
gear in the masthead haul in. As the rope
tautens, ballast is discharged from the ship,
which is slowly hauled into connection with the
automatic coupling already set in the open position
to receive the attachment on the nose.
When once this coupling is closed, the mooring
ropes can be dispensed with, the ship's rope being
re-wound on to the storage drum in the
bows.</p>

<p>After landing at the masthead, connection is
made with the hydrogen, gasoline, oil, and water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>mains, and fresh gas, fuel and water ballast are
placed on board, so that the ship may be kept in
trim during the discharge of cargo, and so the
embarkation of passengers and stores be effected.</p>

<p>When all is ready to leave the masthead for
flight, the pulling of a lever in the automatic
coupling releases the ship. The latter then
draws astern and upward, under the influence of
the prevailing wind, until it is well clear of the
landing station and can proceed on its course.</p>

<p>The design of this apparatus is such that the
landing of an airship is as easy in a wind as
in complete calm. With its help an airship can
land in any speed of wind in which it is safe to
fly. Should the wind be so high (over 60 or 70
miles per hour) that the vessel cannot reach a
given mast, it will always be possible to learn
by wireless the nearest station at which favorable
conditions allow it to come down.</p>

<p>The release of the ship from the mast can
take place in any wind-speed. Owing to the
comparatively local nature of a big storm
(storms are known not to cover districts greater
than two hundred miles in diameter) the vessel,
after slipping its moorings, is able to circumnavigate
the disturbed area by making a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>small initial deviation from the true course.</p>

<p>A part of the aërodrome should be given over
to aëroplanes, used for the bringing of mails
and urgent freight from places distant from the
terminal. Heavier-than-air machines, in fact,
will be the veins leading to the great arteries
of the world's air routes, operated by dirigibles.
A strong searchlight, for the guidance of aëroplane
pilots flying in fog, might be necessary.
Given improved landing facilities, means might
be found for them to coast down the searchlight,
if the ground away from it were invisible.
Another method of delivering mails, before
leaving for a landing ground away from
the fog belt, is to drop them, attached to a parachute.
When the package reaches earth it can
be located by an electric bell, which rings on impact
and continues ringing.</p>

<p>The mail services of to-day, by railway and
boat, can in many cases be greatly speeded up
if part of a long journey be covered by aëroplane.
A good instance is the route between
Great Britain and South America. If a merchant
in London posts three letters to correspondents
in New York, Rio de Janeiro and
Buenos Ayres respectively, he may have a reply
from New York before the Brazil man has had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>time to read his communication, and four or
five days before the man in the Argentine has
received his. An aërial short cut to Dakar&mdash;already
several machines have flown there from
Paris&mdash;would lessen by six or seven days the
transit time for mailbags sent from England to
Rio de Janeiro or Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>As long as the internal combustion engine is
used in aëronautics, and mechanical failure is
always a possibility to be reckoned with, the
cost of maintaining aëroplane routes, even if
they be only auxiliary to dirigible or steamship
services, will be greatly swollen by the need of
maintaining frequent landing grounds. Every
ten miles would be an ideal interval for them;
every twenty miles is a minimum for first-rate
insurance against risk. From a height of five
thousand feet, the probable average minimum
elevation for commercial air navigation, a pilot
can without difficulty cover a distance of five
miles while planing down without the aid of
motors. From ten thousand feet he can cover
ten miles under the same conditions; so that
at this height he would never be outside gliding
distance of landing grounds prepared every
twenty miles.</p>

<p>Given these safeguards, the element of risk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>in present day aviation is no greater than it
was in the early days of railways and steamboats;
and little, if any, greater than in modern
motoring. Many people, possessing only a
newspaper acquaintance with aërial affairs,
still believe mechanical flight to be perilous.
In exactly the same manner men shunned the
infant steamboat, railway train, bicycle and
motor-car. Yet, proportionately, the aëroplane
and the dirigible are responsible for no more
deaths than the train or the automobile. The
seeming discrepancy is because so much attention
is paid to air fatalities. Every week-end
motor-car accidents cause scores of fatalities.
Yet the death in harness of a single aviator
produces more comment than all of these.
Partly, no doubt, the intense horror with which
humanity regards death by falling from a great
height is due to its novelty among human experiences.</p>

<p>The airways of the world offer some pretty
problems of international politics, involving
commerce, rights of landing, customs duties, air
smuggling, air traffic regulations and air laws.
All these were dealt with in the International
Aërial Commission at the Peace Conference,
which agreed upon the following principles:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p>1. Recognition of the greatest possible freedom
of aërial navigation, as far as that freedom
of navigation is reconcilable with the principle
of the sovereignty of each state in the air above
its territory, with the security of the state affected,
and in conformity with a strict enforcement
of safety regulations.</p>

<p>2. Regulation under obligatory permits for
pilots and other aëronautical personnel to be
recognized mutually by the signatory states.</p>

<p>3. The establishment of international air
rules, including signals, lights, methods of
avoiding collisions and regulations for landing.</p>

<p>4. The recognition of the special treatment of
army, navy and state machines when on duty
for the state.</p>

<p>5. Recognition of the right to utilize all public
aërodromes in other states, under a charge
to be uniform for the aircraft of all nations, including
the home nation.</p>

<p>6. Recognition of the right of crossing one
country to another, with the privilege of landing,
but under the reservation of the right of
the state crossed to apply its local rules, and
if necessary to force the landing of the visiting
machines on signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Recognition of the principle of mutual indemnity
to cover damages to persons or property
due to aircraft&mdash;the state of the offending
machine to make reparation and then to recoup
itself in any way it sees fit.</p>

<p>8. Recognition of the necessity of a permanent
international aëronautical commission, in
order to keep the development of the legal side
of aviation abreast of the development of the
science itself.</p>

<p>9. Recognition of the obligation of each state
to regulate its internal legislation along the
lines of the clauses of the international agreement.</p>

<p>The main airways of the world are still hypothetical,
but some of their main terminals, in
relation to the centers of industry and population
and the trade routes, will certainly be London,
New York, San Francisco, Tokio, Delhi,
Colombo, Cairo, Cape Town, and Rio de Janeiro.
In particular London, New York, Cairo
and Rio de Janeiro are fitted to be great junctions
for air traffic. London is the logical distribution
center for passengers and freight
from North and South America bound for Continental
Europe or the East. The New York
terminal should link the transatlantic airways
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>from Europe with the airways of North America.
Rio de Janeiro should perform the same
function for South America, and also be the
center of seaplane traffic up the Amazon. Cairo
is destined to be the junction for the air routes
between Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.
From it dirigibles or aëroplanes may pass to
India (via Damascus and Bagdad), to Cape
Town (via Nairobi), to Australia (via Aden and
Colombo, or Delhi and Singapore), and to London
(via Algiers or some point in Southern
Italy). Cairo is also likely to be an important
base for seaplanes and flying boats plying up
and down the tremendous waterways of the Nile
and the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>The British Empire is especially bound up
with the airways of the future. The geographical
position of the Briton forces him to think
in Imperial terms. In 1776 Great Britain lost
her most valuable colonies largely because the
Atlantic Ocean made adequate representation
of the colonial interest physically impossible.
Since that day cables, steamships and the wireless
have helped to overcome the distances that
separate the overseas dominions from the British
Isles. Aircraft and well-organized British
air routes should be the greatest step in the consolidation
of the far-flung Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<p>To this end British official experts mapped
out the stages of the aërial route to Australia
from Egypt, via Damascus, Bagdad, Karachi,
Delhi, Calcutta, Singapore and Sumatra. Although
the successive landing grounds were not
ready in time for Captain Ross-Smith's magnificent
flight from England to Australia, the
information and advice collected by the official
surveyors were of inestimable value to him. It
is noteworthy that nearly the whole of the proposed
airway from Egypt to Australia is over
British territory or the sea.</p>

<p>The same is true of the proposed route from
Cairo to Cape Town. This was planned out
very carefully by three parties of military aviators,
who covered the whole length of civilized
and uncivilized Africa in their search for landing
grounds. The absorption of German East
Africa by the South African Union makes an
all British corridor for aircraft from Cairo to
Cape Town, by way of Egypt, the Sudan, British
East Africa, British Central Africa, German
East Africa, Rhodesia, the Transvaal and Cape
Colony. There is an alternative water route
over the Nile, the Great Lakes, the Zambezi
River and along the coast to Cape Town. Being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>the junction of the airways to India, Australia
and South Africa, Egypt is destined to
be the nerve center of an air-linked British Empire,
just as the Suez Canal has been its jugular
vein.</p>

<p>But the laying out of great air routes to the
East and South does not complete Britain's
plans. She must connect them up with London&mdash;a
task which is much more complicated from
the standpoint of high politics, because it involves
routes over the territory of other nations.
An aëroplane can fly from London to Cairo via
Gibraltar without passing over foreign territory
or foreign territorial waters. But the air
route would be long and the aërodrome bases
great distances apart, in comparison with the
proposed land route of two thousand miles
across France, down the length of Italy and
Greece and across the Mediterranean to Cairo.
Such a route necessitates an entente cordiale
with the nations of Western Europe, and is one
of the reasons why Great Britain can never contemplate
easily a loosening of the bonds that
now hold together the Allies of Western Europe.</p>

<p>The French, for their part, are also thinking
of air routes in terms of their colonial possessions.
For them the international situation is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>much the same as for the London-Cairo airway.
French pilots need not fly over foreign territory
to Algiers or Morocco. A long flight across the
Mediterranean, or skirting the west coast of
Spain, is a possibility. But Spanish territory
is the logical corridor from France to Africa.
It was over Spain that a trip was made from
Toulouse to Casablanca, the eighteen hundred
miles being covered in eleven hours of actual
flying. The ordinary postal service takes six
days. For direct aërial communication with
Syria, also, France must have an entente with
several intervening countries.</p>

<p>Not only will the aëroplane connect France
more closely with Africa; it will likewise bind
together the various sections of France's colonial
territory in Africa, The Sahara Desert
will become a less formidable obstacle to intercommunication.
French pilots have made
experimental flights over parts of the Sahara in
a search for the best routes and landing places,
as links in communication between Morocco and
the Ivory Coast.</p>

<p>When technical progress and perfected organization
place the world's main airways in
operation, there will be enormous saving of
time on the longer routes. The estimated time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>for transatlantic flights from London to New
York by the three million, five hundred thousand
cubic feet dirigibles is two to two and one-half
days, Other likely figures for various
services are as follows:</p>

<p>Owing to variation in the weather conditions,
latitude in estimating the time of arrival must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>be permitted in each case. Where, however,
there is a saving of several days in comparison
with steamship travel, the difference of a few
hours matters little.</p>

<p>In years to come, with the development
of airship transport to the most distant centers
of the world, it is conceivable that no important
city will be further from London than
ten days' journey. The following table, as applied
to a London terminal, is by no means fantastic:</p>

<p>As the maximum distance of direct flight between
intermediate stations is not more than
three thousand, five hundred miles, it would be
practicable to run these services with the size
of airship described three million, five hundred
thousand cubic feet capacity. The cost of operation
for regular services would be approximately
as for the Atlantic service&mdash;passengers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>at the rate of eight cents per mile, and mails at
the rate of six cents per ounce. With the development
of larger airships, carrying greater
loads, the cost should be more economical.</p>

<p>I admit that such a near-Utopia of an air age
may not be seen by the present decade, and that
its attainment demands great results from science,
statesmanship and business organization.
Yet even to come within sight of world intercommunication
as rapid as is indicated by the
signposts of present-day aëronautics would
make possible an era of greater prosperity,
peace and friendliness. If people, their written
communications and their goods can be
taken from continent to continent as quickly, or
nearly as quickly, as a cablegram, the twin evils
of state parochialism and international misunderstanding
will less often be dragged from the
cupboard in which the world's racial skeletons
are kept. The airship and the aëroplane may
well become a greater influence towards internationalization
than the signed covenant of the
league of nations.</p>
